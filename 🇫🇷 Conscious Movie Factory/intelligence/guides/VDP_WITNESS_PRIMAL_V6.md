# REJECTION CRITERIA

* [ ] Visual is a "Metaphor" (e.g., a cartoon cloud) instead of a Body Part.
* [ ] "Fog" is shown as weather, not as a physical symptom (rubbing eyes).
* [ ] No Texture (Sweat/Skin/Condensation) in the Mechanism phase.
* [ ] Energy numbers shown *only* as text, not as body language.
