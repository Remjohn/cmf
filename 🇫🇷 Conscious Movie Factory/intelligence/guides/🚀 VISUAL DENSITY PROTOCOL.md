# 🧬 PRIMAL DENSITY PROTOCOL (v4.2)

## For The Storyboard Architect — Biologically Optimized Visuals

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: WHERE THIS PROTOCOL APPLIES

| Stage | VDP Applies? | What Guides It |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Script** | ❌ NO | Transcript quotes verbatim |
| **Lyrics** | ❌ NO | Script content (poetic translation) |
| **Storyboard** | ✅ YES | VDP transforms lyrics into scroll-stopping visuals |

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

> **"Texture + Action = Story. Texture alone = Stock Photo."**
> Context is not "the room." Context is **how the body TOUCHES the room.**

---

## ⚠️ THE "MID-SHOT TRAP" (Why Images Look Boring)

**Theory:** Mid-shots (waist up) are the "Friend Zone" of visual content. Safe, standard, ignorable.

**The Fix:** Operate at the **EXTREMES**.

| Shot Type | Purpose | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Extreme Macro** | Texture/Biology — Stops scroll | Hands, lips, skin contact with objects |
| **Extreme Wide** | Isolation/Context — Sets mood | Establishing shots, environment |
| **BANNED** | Standard eye-level mid-shots without tension | Never |

---

## 📸 THE "SENSORY ZOOM" RULE (v4.2 Core Update)

> **For every "Action" prompt, you MUST specify a FOCAL POINT of TEXTURE.**

**Context is not just "the room."**
**Context is how the body TOUCHES the room.**

| Body Part | Touching What | Creates |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Hands | Gripping table edge | Anxiety/Tension |
| Feet | Cold tile floor | Vulnerability |
| Face | Pressed against window | Longing/Trapped |
| Fingers | Digging into bicep | Self-comfort/Panic |
| Lips | Rim of glass | Sensory moment |

### Bad vs Good:

| Bad (Mid-Shot Trap) | Good (Sensory Zoom) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| "Wide shot of Nina entering hospital" | "Close-up on Nina's hand **pushing the heavy hospital door**, veins prominent on wrist, metal door handle cold and scratched" |
| "Woman drinking green juice in kitchen" | "**Extreme Close-Up:** Lips stained green, throat swallowing, condensation on glass gripping wet fingers" |
| "Person sleeping" | "**Macro:** Eyelid twitching (REM sleep), sweat on hairline, pillowcase creased against cheek" |

---

## ⚡ THE "TEXTURE-IN-CONTEXT" FORMULA

Do not just show "Woman drinking juice."
Show **"The biological reaction to the juice."**

| Boring Mid-Shot | **Primal Density v4.2** | **Why It Wins** |
|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Woman drinking green juice in sunlight | **Macro:** Lips stained green, throat swallowing (Adam's apple moving), condensation on glass gripping wet fingers | T1 (Flesh) + T8 (Sensory): We *feel* the cold and the swallow |
| Arm in hallway | **Macro:** Fingers digging into bicep, skin indented from pressure, blurred hallway lights in background | T1 (Tension) + Context: We *feel* the anxiety |
| Person scrolling phone | **Close-Up:** Thumb mid-scroll, screen glow on fingernail, other hand gripping coffee cup | T2 (Private) + T3 (Artifact): Intimacy + Objects |

## THE 8 DOPAMINE TRIGGERS (T-Codes)

### 🔴 T1: THE FLESH (Vulnerability Through Body LANGUAGE)

**Theory:** Humans stop for visible vulnerability — NOT just macro skin.
**v4.2 Rule:** Show **BODY part TOUCHING object** — creates tension.

* **✅ CORRECT:** "Hands gripping steering wheel until knuckles white, veins visible"
* **❌ BANNED:** "Mid-shot of person looking worried"

### 🟣 T2: THE PRIVATE BEHAVIOR (Voyeurism)

**Theory:** We stop to see what people do when alone.
**v4.2 Rule:** Show the **TEXTURE** of private moments.

* **❌ BANNED:** "Wide shot of person in bed with phone"

### 🔵 T3: THE ARTIFACT (Material Anchors)

**Theory:** Objects make abstract real.
**v4.2 Rule:** Show **HANDS interacting** with object.

* **✅ CORRECT:** "Fingers gripping pill bottle, label partially visible" 
* **❌ BANNED:** "Pills on table"

### 🟢 T4: THE NUMBER (Logic Trap)

* *Keywords:* "3:14 AM", "-$400", "7 out of 10"

### 🟠 T5: THE NAMED ENEMY (Tribal Signal)

* *Keywords:* "Hustle Culture", "Toxic Positivity"

### 🟡 T6: THE FAILED SOLUTION (Validation)

* *Keywords:* Meditation apps, Keto, Talk Therapy

## ⚡ THE KINETIC MULTIPLIER (No Static Rule)

**Never leave a sensory trigger passive. Always pair with a VERB OF STRUGGLE.**

| Passive (Weak) | Kinetic (Strong) | Why It Wins |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Goosebumps | **Rubbing arms** aggressively | Rejection of fear |
| Sweat | **Wiping** with trembling hand | Struggle for composure |
| Tears | **Choking back** sob | Fight for control |
| Clenched jaw | **Grinding** teeth until ache | Duration & pressure |

---

## 🧠 THE CONTEXT IMPERATIVE (No Void Rule)

**Every prompt must answer: "What object is the character TOUCHING?"**

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "Show Anxiety" | "Hands gripping the **steering wheel**" |
| "Show Cold" | "Rubbing arms in **open fridge light**" |
| "Show Sadness" | "Staring at **empty chair** at table" |

---

## 🔒 CHARACTER ANCHOR LOCK

Every prompt MUST start with:

```
[0. CHARACTER ANCHOR — LOCKED]
[Name], [age], [ethnicity]. SKIN: [Exact tone]. [Hair]. [Accessories].
```

**Negative Prompt Must Include:**
`No light skin, no medium brown. No solid backgrounds. No studio lighting. No floating subjects. No standard mid-shots.`

---

## 🚨 MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS

**SHOT TYPE RULE:** Every prompt must specify:
- **EXTREME MACRO** (hands/lips/eyes + object contact) OR
- **EXTREME WIDE** (isolation/atmosphere)
- **NEVER** standard mid-shot without texture

**SENSORY ZOOM RULE:** Every prompt must include:
- Body part + Object it's touching + Texture detail

**HOOK RULE:** First scene MUST contain T2 (Private Behavior) with Sensory Zoom

## 📊 SCORING (v4.2)

| Trigger | Points | Bonus |

## ✅ FINAL VERDICT

> **Mid-shots get ignored. EXTREMES get watched.**
> Context is not the room. Context is **how skin touches the room**.

Every image must be a **Scene from a Movie**, not a **Stock Photo from Shutterstock**.
