# 📐 FRAME ALIGNMENT SCORING RUBRIC

**Objective:** To mathematically score how well a candidate quote reinforces the Unified Frame Statement.

## The Principle of Frame Supremacy
> "A 10/10 funny quote that contradicts the Frame is a 0/10 for the script."

## Scoring Table (0-10)

| Score | Description | Effect on Combined Score |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **10** | **Holographic:** The quote encapsulates the WHOLE Frame (Problem + Mechanism + Result) in one sentence. | **Multiplier: 1.5x** |
| **8-9** | **Strong Support:** The quote directly addresses a key pillar of the Frame (e.g., specific Problem or specific Result). | **Multiplier: 1.2x** |
| **5-7** | **Neutral/Tangential:** Good content, but could belong to any interview. Generic wisdom. | **Multiplier: 1.0x** |
| **3-4** | **Distraction:** Interesting sidebar that pulls focus AWAY from the main arc. | **Multiplier: 0.5x** |
| **0-2** | **Contradiction:** Active disagreement with the Frame or confusingly off-brand. | **Multiplier: 0.0x (DISCARD)** |

## Example

**Frame:** *"Matthis overcomes anxiety (Problem) through liver detox (Mechanism) to regain his stage presence (Result)."*

**Candidate Quotes:**

1. *"I felt like I was dying on stage."*
   - **Analysis:** Describes the Problem vividly.
   - **Frame Score:** 9/10 (Strong Support)

2. *"The liver tracks grief like a black box."*
   - **Analysis:** Explains the Mechanism clearly.
   - **Frame Score:** 9/10 (Strong Support)

3. *"I also started knitting to relax."*
   - **Analysis:** True, but irrelevant to the "Liver Detox" mechanism.
   - **Frame Score:** 3/10 (Distraction) → **DISCARD**

4. *"With Adele, we detox the mind, not just the body."*
   - **Analysis:** Connects Mechanism to Result. Holographic.
   - **Frame Score:** 10/10 (Holographic)

## Usage in Mining

**Combined Score Formula:**
`Final_Quote_Score = (Viral_Trinity_Score) * (Frame_Alignment_Multiplier)`

*Example:*
- Viral Score: 25/30 (High Surprise/Emotion)
- Frame Score: 3/10 (Distraction, 0.5x)
- **Final Score: 12.5 (REJECTED)**
