## 1. The Specificity Ladder (The Sensory Memory)
**Question:** How clear is the memory?
*We are looking for SMELL, TOUCH, and LIGHT. Not just facts.*

| Score | Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **10/10** | **The Proustian** | Evokes a specific scent, texture, or quality of light. | "The smell of rain on hot asphalt in 1999." |
| **8-9/10** | **The Snapshot** | Clear visual detail. | "My grandmother's yellow kitchen table." |
| **6-7/10** | **The Event** | A specific event. | "My graduation day." |
| **4-5/10** | **The Era** | "Back in my 20s." |
| **0-3/10** | **The Blur** | "In the past." |

**Validation Rule:** IF Cluster is **QR3 (The Look Back)**, Specificity MUST be ≥8/10 to ground the nostalgia.

## 2. Setup Validation (The Noise Check)
**Question:** Does the story start with CHAOS to earn the SILENCE?

| Score | Level | Metric |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **10/10** | **The Cacophony** | Overwhelming speed/noise. "Running, shouting, scrolling." |
| **7-9/10** | **The Rush** | "I was always busy." |
| **4-6/10** | **The Blur** | "Things were crazy." |
| **0-3/10** | **The Calm** | "I was sitting quietly." (Fails Setup). |

**Validation Rule:** IF Cluster is **QR1 (The Noise)**, Score MUST be ≥7/10.

## 3. Vulnerability Hierarchy (The Regret)
**Question:** What did you miss while you were busy?

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **10/10** | **The Ghost** | Identifying a specific person/moment lost forever. |
| **8-9/10** | **The Youth** | Missing one's own innocence/energy. |
| **6-7/10** | **The Time** | "I wasted time." |
| **0-5/10** | **The Nothing** | "I have no regrets." (Boring). |
