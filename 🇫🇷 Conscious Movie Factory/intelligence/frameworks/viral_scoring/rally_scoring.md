**Arc Type:** The Rally (Community/Movement Building)
**Key Emotion:** Determination / Shared Mission
**Goal:** Move the audience from ISOLATION to COLLECTIVE ACTION.

---

## 1. THE 3 SCORING PILLARS (Viral Trinity)

Every quote is scored on three dimensions (0-10 each).
**Total Score = Surprise + Emotion + Specificity (Max 30)**

### A. SURPRISE (The "Wait, really?" Factor)
For Rally, surprise comes from the **SCALE** of the problem or the **BOLDNESS** of the solution.

- **10/10:** Subverts a core societal belief. ("We think X is normal, but it's actually oppression.")
- **7-9/10:** Reveals a hidden enemy or system. ("The system is designed to make you fail.")
- **4-6/10:** Standard inspirational statement. ("We can do this.")
- **0-3/10:** Cliché platitude. ("Teamwork makes the dream work.")

**Rally-Specific Validations:**
- IF score ≥ 7: Must name the "Enemy" or "System" specifically.
- CHECK: Does this surprise rely on a "We" vs "They" dynamic?

### B. EMOTION (The "Visceral" Factor)
For Rally, emotion is measured by **COLLECTIVE STAKES**.

- **10/10:** Existential Threat / Sacred Duty. ("If we don't act, our children lose.")
- **7-9/10:** Shared anger/frustration. ("We are tired of being ignored.")
- **4-6/10:** Generic hope/optimism. ("Ideally things improve.")
- **0-3/10:** Corporate/Clinical tone. ("Synergy is important.")

**Vulnerability Hierarchy (Rally-Specific):**
| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 10/10 | **Defiance** | "We refuse to accept this anymore." (Active rejection) |
| 8-9/10 | **Determination** | "We will find a way." (Grounded resolve) |
| 6-7/10 | **Hope** | "Better days are coming." (Optimism) |
| 4-5/10 | **Complaint** | "It's really hard right now." (Passive venting) |
| 0-3/10 | **Observation** | "Things are changing." (Detached) |

### C. SPECIFICITY (The "Proof" Factor)
For Rally, specificity means **CONCRETE ACTION**.

- **10/10:** Specific Action + Deadline + Outcome. ("Sign the petition by Friday to stop Bill 404.")
- **7-9/10:** Specific Action. ("Join us at the march.")
- **4-6/10:** Vague Action. ("Get involved.")
- **0-3/10:** No Action. ("Awareness is key.")

**Collective Action Specificity Ladder:**
| Score | Level | Elements Present |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| 10 | **Campaign** | Action + Time + Goal ("Raise $50k by Tuesday") |
| 9 | **Event** | "Join the webinar on the 5th" |
| 8 | **Task** | "Click the link below" |
| 6-7 | **Identity** | "Become a member" |
| 3-5 | **Sentiment** | "Support the cause" |
| 0-2 | **Nothing** | No clear next step |

## 2. CLUSTER-SPECIFIC THRESHOLDS

Quotes must meet these minimums to be selected for a cluster.

| Cluster | Function | Minimum Trinity Score | Mandatory Check |
|---------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| **RA1 SETBACK** | The Fall | **18/30** | Must show **Defeat** (not just struggle) |
| **RA2 FRUSTRATION** | The Loop | **20/30** | Must show **Repetition** ("Tried again and again") |
| **RA3 FOCUS** | The Decision | **25/30** | Must be **Binary** ("Enough.") + **Sonic Vacuum** capable |
| **RA4 ACTION** | Momentum | **24/30** | Must score **≥8/10 on Specificity Ladder** |

---

## 3. SCORING BONUSES (Viral Patterns)

Add +2 to final score if:

- **"The Turn":** Quote starts with defeat and ends with fire in the same breath.
- **"The Us":** Uses "We/Us/Our" 3+ times in one sentence naturalistically.
- **"The Enemy":** Specifically names the opposing force (e.g., "The Diet Industry", "Big Pharma").

---

## 4. EXAMPLE SCORING

**Quote:** *"They want you to stay quiet. They profit from your silence. But next Tuesday, we show up. All of us."*

- **Surprise:** 8/10 (Names the motive "profit from silence")
- **Emotion:** 9/10 (Defiance/Sacred Duty)
- **Specificity:** 7/10 (Action "show up", Time "Tuesday", but no specific location)
- **Bonus:** +2 ("The Enemy" named as "They" with motive)

**Total:** 8+9+7 + 2 = **26/30 (Excellent)**
