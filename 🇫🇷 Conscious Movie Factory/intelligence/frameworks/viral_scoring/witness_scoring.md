# Witness Arc - Viral Trinity Scoring Rubric (ENHANCED)

**Emotional Journey:** Introduction → Pain → Discovery → Proof → Endorsement
**Clusters:** W1 (Hook), W2 (Problem), W3 (Mechanism), W4 (Proof), W5 (Close)

## Scoring Philosophy

In a **Witness Arc**, the power comes from AUTHENTICITY and SPECIFICITY. The viewer needs to believe this is a real person with real results.

**Viral Trinity Reframed for Witness:**
- **Surprise:** Counter-intuitive mechanisms or unexpected connections
- **Emotion:** Vulnerability and transformation contrast
- **Specificity:** Numbers, timelines, sensory details that prove it's real

---

## 🆕 PROOF SPECIFICITY LADDER (Principle A)

**Core Insight:** "Trust comes from numbers, not adjectives."

Not all specificity is equal in testimonials. This ladder ranks proof quality:

| Score | Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **10/10** | Triple Specificity | Number + Timeline + Comparison/Context | "My migraines went from 15 per month to 2 per month in 8 weeks with Adele" |
| **8-9/10** | Double Specificity | Metrics + Timeline | "I lost 8 kilos in 3 weeks" |
| **6-7/10** | Single Metric | Number/percentage alone | "My energy is now at 7/10" |
| **4-5/10** | Named Details | Specific symptoms/changes | "The bloating disappeared", "Anxiety attacks stopped" |
| **2-3/10** | Sensory Details | Subjective feelings | "I feel lighter", "I can breathe again" |
| **0-1/10** | Abstract | Generic claims | "I feel better", "Things improved" |

**Critical Rule for Witness:** W4 (PROOF) cluster MUST score ≥6/10 on this ladder. Anything below = auto-reject.

**Usage:** When scoring Specificity (1-10) for W4 quotes, use THIS ladder instead of the generic one below.

## 🆕 SETUP VALIDATION PROTOCOL (Principle B)

**Core Insight:** "You can't subvert expectations people don't have."

For quotes scoring ≥8/10 on Surprise, validate that the SETUP exists:

### Witness Arc Surprise Validation

**Common Surprise Type:** Counter-intuitive mechanisms ("My X was actually Y")

**Required Setup:** The transcript should show the client tried conventional approaches first.

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Identify the assumption:** What does the quote challenge?
2. **Check for setup:** Did they mention mainstream/conventional attempts?
3. **Adjust score:** If setup missing, reduce Surprise by 2-3 points

**Example:**
- Quote: "My back pain was actually my fear of responsibility." (Surprise: 9/10)
- Assumption: Back pain has physical causes (doctors/PT should fix it)
- Validation: Did they mention seeing doctors/physical therapists first?
  - ✅ YES: Keep Surprise 9/10 (has contrast)
  - ❌ NO: Reduce to Surprise 6/10 (lacks context)

---

## 🆕 VULNERABILITY HIERARCHY (Principle C)

**Core Insight:** "Generic pain doesn't move people. Specific shame does."

Not all emotions are equally powerful. This hierarchy ranks emotional depth:

| Score | Level | Type | Example (Witness-Specific) |
|-------|-------|------|---------------------------|
| **10/10** | Visceral | Body-based + Metaphor | "I couldn't get out of bed. Every morning felt like drowning. My whole body was heavy." |
| **8-9/10** | Shameful | Social/relational impact | "I stopped seeing friends. I was too ashamed to tell them I couldn't function." |
| **6-7/10** | Sad | Specific emotional exhaustion | "I cried in the car every day before work." |
| **4-5/10** | Intellectual | Frustration/confusion | "I was frustrated that nothing worked." |
| **2-3/10** | Generic | Overused labels | "I was tired/stressed" |
| **0-1/10** | Detached | Clinical language | "I experienced difficulties" |

**Critical Rule for Witness:** W2 (PROBLEM) cluster should score ≥7/10 on this hierarchy for maximum empathy.

**Usage:** When scoring Emotion (1-10) for W2 quotes, reference THIS hierarchy to determine if the vulnerability is deep enough.

---

## Surprise (1-10)

| Score | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **9-10** | **Mechanism Revelation:** The cure is counter-intuitive | "The liver doesn't just detox toxins—it holds onto grief" |
| **7-8** | **Unexpected Connection:** Links two things viewers wouldn't connect | "My chronic fatigue was linked to my gut, not my thyroid" |
| **5-6** | **Moderate Surprise:** Non-obvious but believable | "I thought it was age, but it was nutrient absorption" |
| **3-4** | **Predictable Insight:** Common knowledge, nicely stated | "Stress affects sleep" |
| **1-2** | **Zero Surprise:** Completely expected | "I felt tired before, now I feel better" |

**Witness-Specific Bonuses:**
- +2 if reveals HIDDEN ROOT CAUSE (symptom X was caused by Y)
- +1 if challenges conventional medicine/mainstream advice

**🆕 Setup Validation:** For Surprise ≥8, validate assumption exists (see Setup Validation Protocol above)

---

## Emotion (1-10)

| Score | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **9-10** | **Raw Vulnerability:** Visceral pain or profound relief | "I couldn't get out of bed. Every morning felt like drowning" |
| **7-8** | **Strong Feeling:** Clear emotion with personal stakes | "I was frustrated. Nothing worked. I felt hopeless" |
| **5-6** | **Moderate Emotion:** Feeling present but not deeply visceral | "It was hard. I struggled for a while" |
| **3-4** | **Muted Emotion:** Clinical or detached | "I experienced some difficulties" |
| **1-2** | **No Emotion:** Completely neutral | "My situation was suboptimal" |

**Witness-Specific Bonuses:**
- +2 if shows BEFORE/AFTER emotional contrast in one sentence
- +1 if uses powerful metaphor (e.g., "like climbing a ladder of lucidity")
- +1 if includes physical/body sensations (shaking, crying, relief)

**🆕 Vulnerability Check:** For W2 (PROBLEM) quotes, reference Vulnerability Hierarchy above. Target ≥7/10.

## Specificity (1-10)

| Score | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **9-10** | **Triple Specificity:** Numbers + Timeline + Sensory Detail | "In 6 weeks, my energy went from 3 to 8. I can work full days again" |
| **7-8** | **Double Specificity:** Two types (e.g., number + timeline) | "I lost 8 kilos in the first month" |
| **5-6** | **Single Specificity:** One concrete detail | "I sleep through the night now" |
| **3-4** | **Vague Improvement:** No numbers, just general improvement | "Things got better" |
| **1-2** | **Abstract:** No concrete details | "I feel transformed" |

**Witness-Specific Requirements:**
- **W4 (PROOF) Cluster:** MUST score ≥7 on Specificity (needs numbers/metrics)
  - **🆕 Use Proof Specificity Ladder above for W4 scoring**
- **W1 (HOOK) Cluster:** MUST mention Coach by name (+3 auto-bonus if present)
