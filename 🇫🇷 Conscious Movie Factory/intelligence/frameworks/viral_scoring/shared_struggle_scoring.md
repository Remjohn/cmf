## Scoring Philosophy

In a **Shared Struggle Arc**, the power comes from COLLECTIVE VALIDATION. "I thought I was alone, but we're all fighting this."

**Viral Trinity Reframed:**
- **Surprise:** The realization that this struggle is UNIVERSAL, not personal failure
- **Emotion:** Loneliness → Belonging. "You're not broken. We ALL feel this."
- **Specificity:** "We" language. Naming the shared enemy. Community size/reach.

## 🆕 COLLECTIVE SPECIFICITY LADDER (Principle A)

**Core Insight:** Specificity = SCALE of the struggle.

| Score | Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **10/10** | Stats + Population + Enemy | Quantified prevalence + demographic + systemic cause | "90% of women in their 40s report feeling invisible. The patriarchy conditions us to shrink as we age." |
| **8-9/10** | Community Size + Descriptor | Specific number + identity | "We're 10,000 mothers who lost ourselves in caregiving." |
| **6-7/10** | Named Community | Specific group but no scale | "Women entrepreneurs struggling with imposter syndrome." |
| **4-5/10** | General "We" Language | Collective but vague | "People like us feel this way." |
| **2-3/10** | "Many people" | No specificity | "A lot of people struggle with this." |
| **0-1/10** | "Everyone" | Too generic | No credibility |

**Critical Rule:** SS2 (RECOGNITION) cluster MUST score ≥7/10 to establish universal nature.

## 🆕 SETUP VALIDATION PROTOCOL (Principle B)

**Core Insight:** Universality is only surprising if isolation was established first.

### Shared Struggle Arc Surprise Validation

**Common Surprise Type:** "This is UNIVERSAL, not just me"

**Required Setup:** Transcript should show isolation/shame ("I thought I was alone")

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Check for isolation:** Did they express feeling alone/defective earlier?
2. **Adjust score:** If isolation not established, reduce Surprise by 2-3 points

**Example:**
- Quote: "90% of women feel this. You're not broken." (Surprise: 9/10)
- Validation: Did they say "I thought I was the only one" or similar earlier?
  - ✅ YES: Keep Surprise 9/10 (validates isolation → universal shift)
  - ❌ NO: Reduce to Surprise 6/10 (stat without personal context)

## 🆕 COLLECTIVE VULNERABILITY HIERARCHY (Principle C)

**Core Insight:** Shared pain needs collective physical/emotional markers.

| Score | Level | Type | Example (Shared Struggle-Specific) |
|-------|-------|------|-----------------------------------|
| **10/10** | Collective Visceral | Shared body experience | "We all know that feeling—waking up with our hearts racing, not wanting to face the day." |
| **8-9/10** | Collective Shame | Shared hiding/performing | "We smile and say we're fine while we're dying inside. We've all done it." |
| **6-7/10** | Collective Grief | Shared loss | "We've all lost parts of ourselves we'll never get back." |
| **4-5/10** | Collective Frustration | Mental fatigue | "We're all tired of the same advice." |
| **2-3/10** | Generic Struggle | No depth | "We struggle" |
| **0-1/10** | Detached | Clinical | "There are challenges" |

**Critical Rule:** SS1 (ISOLATION) should score ≥7/10 individually before shifting to collective in SS2.
