## 1. The Specificity Ladder (Grounded Mysticism)
**Question:** How visceral is the spiritual experience?
*Avoid "Woo-Woo". We want BIOLOGY and PHYSICS.*

| Score | Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **10/10** | **The Somatic** | Sensation in the body. Physical reaction. | "A heat started in my heels and shot up my spine." |
| **8-9/10** | **The Precision** | Specific visual/auditory shift. | "The static in my head just stopped." |
| **6-7/10** | **The Metaphor** | Using nature/light as descriptive. | "It was like the sun came out." |
| **4-5/10** | **The Abstract** | Using concepts. | "I felt the universe." |
| **0-3/10** | **The Vague** | Using cliches. | "I awakened." |

**Validation Rule:** IF Cluster is **DS2 (The Spark)**, Specificity MUST be ≥7/10 to avoid "New Age Fluff".

## 2. Setup Validation (The Dark Night)
**Question:** Does the Darkness justify the Light?

| Score | Level | Metric |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **10/10** | **The Void** | Complete hopelessness. Suicidal ideation or total collapse. |
| **7-9/10** | **The Wall** | Hitting a limit. "I couldn't go on." |
| **4-6/10** | **The Fog** | Confusion. "I was lost." |
| **0-3/10** | **The Dip** | Just a bad day. |

**Validation Rule:** IF Cluster is **DS1 (Dark Night)**, Score MUST be ≥7/10. Light has no meaning without Dark.

## 3. Vulnerability Hierarchy (Ego Death)
**Question:** Did the "I" die?

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **10/10** | **Surrender** | Actively giving up control. "Take it. I'm done." |
| **8-9/10** | **Admission** | Admitting powerlessness. "I can't do this." |
| **6-7/10** | **Questioning** | Asking for help. |
| **0-5/10** | **Assertion** | Still trying to fix it. (Ego is alive). |

**Validation Rule:** IF Cluster is **DS3 (Surrender)**, the Ego must DECLARE defeat.
