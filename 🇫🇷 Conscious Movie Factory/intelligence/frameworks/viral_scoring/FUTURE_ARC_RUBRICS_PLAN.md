# Future Arc Rubric Implementation Plan

**Status:** The following 7 arcs DO NOT YET have complete scoring rubrics.  
**Priority:** Witness, Breakthrough, and Shared Struggle are COMPLETE.  
**Secondary:** Confrontation, Core Transformation, and Warning are COMPLETE.  
**Remaining:** The 7 arcs below require full rubric development.

## Arcs Requiring Full Rubric Development

1. **Quiet Reflection Arc**
2. **Comedic Reframe Arc**
3. **Divine Spark Arc**
4. **Call to Adventure Arc**
5. **Rally Arc**
6. **Ticking Clock Arc**
7. **Sacred Return Arc**

## Implementation Template (Use When Ready)

For each arc, create a file: `intelligence/frameworks/viral_scoring/[arc_name]_scoring.md`

Follow this structure (based on the Witness/Breakthrough/Shared Struggle models):

### Section 1: Arc Overview
```markdown
**Arc Type:** [Name]
**Emotional Journey:** [Phase 1] → [Phase 2] → [Phase 3] → [Phase 4]
**Clusters:** [C1], [C2], [C3], [C4] (with specific names for this arc)
```

### Section 2: Scoring Philosophy
Write a 2-3 sentence philosophy statement explaining:
- What makes THIS arc viral (what's the core emotional/intellectual hook?)
- How the Trinity is REFRAMED for this arc specifically

Example from Breakthrough:
> "In a Breakthrough Arc, the power comes from the SUDDEN SHIFT. The 'Wait...' moment. The realization that changes everything. Viral Trinity Reframed: Surprise = The revelation itself, Emotion = Contrast between anxiety and clarity, Specificity = The exact moment it clicked."

### Section 3: Surprise Definition (1-10 Scale)

Create a table with 5 score ranges:
- **9-10:** [Most surprising scenario for THIS arc]
- **7-8:** [Strong surprise]
- **5-6:** [Moderate]
- **3-4:** [Weak]
- **1-2:** [No surprise]

**Arc-Specific Bonuses:**
List 2-3 bonuses that are UNIQUE to this arc.

Example from Confrontation:
- +3 if the quote NAMES THE VILLAIN (Big Pharma, diet industry, etc.)
- +2 if the quote reveals a PROFIT MOTIVE

### Section 4: Emotion Definition (1-10 Scale)

Same structure, but focused on the EMOTIONAL JOURNEY specific to this arc.

**Arc-Specific Bonuses:**
List bonuses for emotional markers unique to this arc.

Example from Breakthrough:
- +3 if the quote includes a SONIC VACUUM moment (silence, pause, breath)
- +2 if the quote uses BODY LANGUAGE ("chest opened," "shoulders dropped")

### Section 5: Specificity Definition (1-10 Scale)

Same structure. Define what "concrete details" mean for THIS arc.

**Arc-Specific Requirements:**
List MANDATORY elements for specific clusters.

Example from Witness:
- W4 (PROOF) Cluster: MUST score ≥7 on Specificity (needs numbers/metrics)

### Section 6: Cluster-Specific Tuning

Create a table showing the WEIGHTED percentages for each cluster:

| Cluster | Surprise % | Emotion % | Specificity % | Min Score |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| [C1]    | [%]       | [%]       | [%]           | [/30]     |
| [C2]    | [%]       | [%]       | [%]           | [/30]     |

**Key Principle:** The cluster that carries the ARC'S CORE MESSAGE should have the highest minimum score.

Example from Breakthrough:
- B3 (EPIPHANY) has a 26/30 minimum—the highest threshold

### Section 7: Special Requirements (If Applicable)

Add any arc-specific mechanics:
- Sonic Vacuum timestamps (Breakthrough)
- Speaker enforcement rules (Witness)
- Named entity requirements (Confrontation)

### Section 8: Example Scoring

Provide 1-2 WORKED EXAMPLES showing:
- The quote
- Raw Trinity scores (Surprise/Emotion/Specificity)
- Weighted calculation for the cluster
- Frame Alignment multiplier
- Final score
- Pass/Fail determination

## Arc-Specific Research Notes (To Be Developed)

### 1. Quiet Reflection Arc
**Core Hook:** Wisdom through loss. "Looking back, I now understand."  
**Key Insight:** The GIFT in the pain. The unexpected lesson from suffering.  
**Surprise Focus:** The counter-intuitive wisdom (what the loss TAUGHT, not just the loss itself)  
**Emotion Focus:** Melancholy → Serenity. Bittersweet acceptance.  
**Specificity Focus:** Sensory details of the MEMORY. The exact moment of understanding.  

**Cluster Structure Hypothesis:**
- QR1: THE MEMORY (vivid sensory details of "before")
- QR2: THE LOSS (what was taken/changed)
- QR3: THE UNDERSTANDING (the gift/lesson)
- QR4: THE PEACE (acceptance/serenity)

**Weighting Hypothesis:**
- QR1 should weight Specificity 50% (needs vivid memory details)
- QR3 should weight Surprise 60% (the unexpected gift)

**Research Needed:**
- Study 5-10 "looking back" viral moments to validate cluster structure
- Identify common patterns in "wisdom through loss" narratives

---

### 2. Comedic Reframe Arc
**Core Hook:** Laughter as pattern interrupt. "Wait, that's actually ridiculous when you think about it."  
**Key Insight:** Finding the ABSURDITY in what we take too seriously.  
**Surprise Focus:** The absurdity itself. Exaggeration or ironic twist.  
**Emotion Focus:** Tension → Laughter → "But seriously though..." (the point behind the joke)  
**Specificity Focus:** The specific absurd detail or punchline quote.  

**Cluster Structure Hypothesis:**
- CR1: THE SETUP (establishing "normal")
- CR2: THE ABSURDITY (the ridiculous element revealed)
- CR3: THE PUNCHLINE (the ironic twist or exaggeration)
- CR4: THE POINT (the serious insight delivered through humor)

**Weighting Hypothesis:**
- CR2 should weight Surprise 70% (absurdity IS the surprise)
- CR3 should weight Surprise 60% + Specificity 30% (punchline must land)

**Special Bonuses:**
- +3 for self-deprecating humor
- +2 for ironic reversal ("You'd think X, but actually X is the problem")

**Research Needed:**
- Study comedic health/wellness content creators
- Identify what makes health humor go viral vs. fall flat

---

### 3. Divine Spark Arc
**Core Hook:** The mystical/spiritual moment. "Grace arrived when I stopped trying."  
**Key Insight:** The PARADOX of surrender. Letting go = receiving.  
**Surprise Focus:** The unexpected arrival of grace/clarity/purpose.  
**Emotion Focus:** Despair → Surrender → Transcendence.  
**Specificity Focus:** The SIGN or SYMBOL. The exact moment/event.  

**Cluster Structure Hypothesis:**
- DS1: THE VOID (emptiness, spiritual darkness)
- DS2: THE SURRENDER (giving up control)
- DS3: THE GRACE (the mystical arrival/sign)
- DS4: THE CALLING (new purpose/direction)

**Weighting Hypothesis:**
- DS2 should weight Emotion 70% (depth of despair → release)
- DS3 should weight Surprise 50% + Specificity 40% (the sign/moment)

**Special Bonuses:**
- +2 for mystical imagery (light, voices, synchronicity)
- +2 for signs/symbols (numbers, animals, dreams)

**Research Needed:**
- Analyze spiritual transformation content
- Define the line between "inspiring" and "too woo-woo" for mass appeal

---

### 4. Call to Adventure Arc
**Core Hook:** The moment of "What if I just..." Restlessness → Courage.  
**Key Insight:** The UNCONVENTIONAL spark that disrupts the status quo.  
**Surprise Focus:** The unexpected catalyst (a book, a conversation, a random sign).  
**Emotion Focus:** Longing → Contemplation → Fear mixed with excitement → The leap.  
**Specificity Focus:** The EXACT conversation/book/moment that sparked the call.  

**Cluster Structure Hypothesis:**
- CA1: THE RESTLESSNESS (something is missing)
- CA2: THE QUESTION ("What if...?")
- CA3: THE SPARK (the catalyst/trigger)
- CA4: THE LEAP (the first step)

**Weighting Hypothesis:**
- CA3 should weight Specificity 50% (needs the exact trigger)
- CA4 should weight Emotion 50% (courage despite fear)

**Special Bonuses:**
- +2 for "What if..." language
- +2 for specific catalyst (book title, conversation quote)

---

### 5. Rally Arc
**Core Hook:** "That failure became my fire." Setback → Comeback.  
**Key Insight:** The FUEL. How defeat transforms into determination.  
**Surprise Focus:** The unexpected SOURCE of motivation (e.g., "proving them wrong").  
**Emotion Focus:** Defeat → Frustration → Grit → Action. "Not today."  
**Specificity Focus:** The exact setback. The rally moment. The action taken.  

**Cluster Structure Hypothesis:**
- R1: THE SETBACK (the failure/defeat, specific)
- R2: THE FRUSTRATION (the low point)
- R3: THE RALLY POINT (the "get up" moment)
- R4: THE COMEBACK (the action/result)

**Weighting Hypothesis:**
- R1 should weight Specificity 50% + Emotion 40% (concrete failure detail)
- R3 should weight Emotion 60% (determination/grit)

**Special Bonuses:**
- +3 for "revenge motivation" language
- +2 for odds/stakes ("They said it was impossible...")

---

### 6. Ticking Clock Arc
**Core Hook:** "I had 30 days or..." Deadline → Decision → Action.  
**Key Insight:** The URGENCY itself is the forcing function.  
**Surprise Focus:** The deadline or catalyst (unexpected diagnosis, ultimatum, opportunity).  
**Emotion Focus:** Complacency → Urgency → Relief. "Time's up. Move."  
**Specificity Focus:** The EXACT deadline/catalyst. The stakes. The decision.  

**Cluster Structure Hypothesis:**
- TC1: THE STAGNATION (stuck/comfortable/avoiding)
- TC2: THE CATALYST (the deadline/event)
- TC3: THE DECISION (choice under pressure)
- TC4: THE MOVE (the action/momentum)

**Weighting Hypothesis:**
- TC2 should weight Specificity 60% (needs exact deadline/event)
- TC3 should weight Emotion 50% + Surprise 30% (high-stakes choice)

**Special Bonuses:**
- +3 for specific timeline ("48 hours," "30 days before...")
- +2 for high stakes ("If I didn't, I'd lose...")

---

### 7. Sacred Return Arc
**Core Hook:** The Hero's Journey. "I had to leave to learn what was home."  
**Key Insight:** The EARNED WISDOM. You can't learn the lesson without the journey.  
**Surprise Focus:** The realization that the answer was "home" all along (but you had to leave to see it).  
**Emotion Focus:** Longing → Hardship → Homecoming → Wholeness.  
**Specificity Focus:** Journey details. The specific "boon" brought back.  

**Cluster Structure Hypothesis:**
- SR1: THE CALL (the departure/reason for leaving)
- SR2: THE JOURNEY (trials, lessons, growth)
- SR3: THE RETURN (homecoming with new eyes)
- SR4: THE GIFT (the wisdom/skill brought back to the community)

**Weighting Hypothesis:**
- SR2 should weight Specificity 50% (needs journey details)
- SR4 should weight Surprise 50% + Emotion 30% (the earned wisdom)

**Special Bonuses:**
- +3 for "full circle" language ("I left searching for X, but found it was home all along")
- +2 for tangible gift/skill brought back

**Research Needed:**
- Study classic hero's journey narratives in wellness/coaching space
- Identify what makes "return" feel earned vs. cliché

## Next Steps for Future Implementation

When ready to implement a remaining arc:

1. **Research Phase:** Watch 5-10 viral videos of that arc type. Take notes on what makes them work.
2. **Cluster Validation:** Confirm the cluster structure matches real-world examples.
3. **Weighting Calibration:** Use the examples to determine which cluster carries the most weight (highest min score).
4. **Write Full Rubric:** Follow the 8-section template above.
5. **Test:** Apply the rubric to 2-3 real transcripts and validate scores feel accurate.
6. **Update Arc Hunter:** Create or update the Arc Hunter agent to load the new rubric.
