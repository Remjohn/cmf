# Core Transformation Arc - Viral Trinity Scoring Rubric (ENHANCED)

**Arc Type:** Core Transformation (Coach's Philosophy)
**Emotional Journey:** Intrigue → Vulnerability → Realization → Empowerment
**Clusters:** CT1 (Hook), CT2 (Wound), CT3 (Wisdom), CT4 (Path)

---

## Scoring Philosophy

**Core Transformation** is the coach's ORIGIN STORY or CORE BELIEF. Think TED Talk meets personal journey.

**Viral Trinity Reframed:**
- **Surprise:** The counter-intuitive insight that changed the coach's entire practice
- **Emotion:** The coach's OWN vulnerability. Their wound. Their transformation.
- **Specificity:** The specific moment/event that forged the philosophy

## 🆕 FORMATIVE EVENT SPECIFICITY LADDER (Principle A)

**Core Insight:** The specificity of the coach's ORIGIN moment.

| Score | Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **10/10** | Date + Place + Moment + Lesson | Complete origin story | "March 2015, sitting in that hospital room watching my mother's labs come back clean while she was dying—that's when I knew allopathic medicine had failed her." |
| **8-9/10** | Event + Specific Lesson | Named moment + insight | "When my first client cried and said 'You're the first person who listened,' I knew protocols were killing the healing." |
| **6-7/10** | General Timeframe + Event | Vague timeline but clear lesson | "Years of practice taught me symptoms are just messengers." |
| **4-5/10** | Generic Origin | Event but no specifics | "My own health crisis led me to holistic medicine." |
| **2-3/10** | "I learned..." | No story | Just claim |
| **0-1/10** | Philosophy | "I believe in holistic health" | No origin |

**Critical Rule:** CT2 (WOUND) cluster MUST score ≥8/10. Coach's vulnerability is the proof.

## 🆕 SETUP VALIDATION PROTOCOL (Principle B)

**Core Insight:** Paradigm shifts require naming the OLD paradigm first.

### Core Transformation Arc Surprise Validation

**Common Surprise Type:** Coach's professional paradigm shift

**Required Setup:** Coach's previous methodology should be mentioned

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Check for OLD method:** Did they describe their original approach?
2. **Adjust score:** If no "before" state, reduce Surprise by 2 points

**Example:**
- Quote: "I stopped following protocols and started listening to bodies." (Surprise: 9/10)
- Validation: Did they mention being protocol-driven initially?
  - ✅ YES: Keep Surprise 9/10 (clear shift)
  - ❌ NO: Reduce to Surprise 7/10 (shift without context)

## 🆕 COACH VULNERABILITY HIERARCHY (Principle C)

**Core Insight:** The coach's wound must be visceral, not philosophical.

| Score | Level | Type | Example (Core Transformation-Specific) |
|-------|-------|------|---------------------------------------|
| **10/10** | Breaking Point | Coach's specific helpless moment | "I sat in that hospital room holding my mother's hand while the machines beeped, and I couldn't save her. That's when I broke." |
| **8-9/10** | Professional Failure | Ego/identity wound | "I was the expert, and I failed her. That realization haunted me for years." |
| **6-7/10** | Personal Loss | Grief | "Losing her changed everything." |
| **4-5/10** | Philosophical Shift | Mental process | "I questioned everything I'd been taught." |
| **2-3/10** | Generic | "It was difficult" | Detached |
| **0-1/10** | No Vulnerability | Just philosophy | No personal stake |

**Critical Rule:** CT2 (WOUND) must score ≥8/10 for authenticity.
