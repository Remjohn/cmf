## Scoring Philosophy

In a **Confrontation Arc**, the power comes from RIGHTEOUS CLARITY. The coach is exposing a lie the industry/system tells.

**Viral Trinity Reframed:**
- **Surprise:** Exposing the hidden agenda or revealing what "they" don't want you to know
- **Emotion:** Frustration → Vindication. "I KNEW something was off!"
- **Specificity:** Named villains. Specific examples of the lie. Data that proves it.

## 🆕 EVIDENCE SPECIFICITY LADDER (Principle A)

**Core Insight:** Evidence quality determines takedown power.

| Score | Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **10/10** | Named Entity + Stat + Motive | Villain + data + exposed incentive | "Weight Watchers has a 95% failure rate. They know this. Their business model depends on you regaining the weight." |
| **8-9/10** | Statistic + Named Entity | Hard data + target | "The diet industry makes $72B a year. 95% of diets fail within 5 years." |
| **6-7/10** | Specific False Claim | Advice + consequence | "They told me 1200 calories. But my body went into starvation mode." |
| **4-5/10** | Generic Industry Critique | Accusation without evidence | "Mainstream medicine gets it wrong." |
| **2-3/10** | "They lie" | Claim without specifics | "The system is broken." |
| **0-1/10** | Vague Conspiracy | No named entity, no proof | Generic distrust |

**Critical Rule:** CF3 (TAKEDOWN) cluster MUST score ≥8/10. Evidence is mandatory.

## 🆕 SETUP VALIDATION PROTOCOL (Principle B)

**Core Insight:** Exposing profit motives is only surprising if trust was established.

### Confrontation Arc Surprise Validation

**Common Surprise Type:** Hidden profit motives / systemic betrayal

**Required Setup:** Transcript should show trust in system initially

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Check for trust:** Did they mention following mainstream advice initially?
2. **Adjust score:** If no initial trust shown, reduce Surprise by 2 points

**Example:**
- Quote: "The diet industry profits from your failure." (Surprise: 10/10)
- Validation: Did they mention trying diets/following industry advice?
  - ✅ YES: Keep Surprise 10/10 (betrayal of trust)
  - ❌ NO: Reduce to Surprise 8/10 (still surprising but less personal)

## 🆕 CONFRONTATION VULNERABILITY HIERARCHY (Principle C)

**Core Insight:** Frustration → Vindication requires visceral betrayal.

| Score | Level | Type | Example (Confrontation-Specific) |
|-------|-------|------|----------------------------------|
| **10/10** | Visceral Rage | Betrayal + body response | "When I found out they knew—they KNEW—and still lied, I wanted to scream. My hands were shaking." |
| **8-9/10** | Shameful | "I was fooled" | "I can't believe I trusted them. I feel so stupid." |
| **6-7/10** | Sad | Disappointment | "I'm heartbroken that the system failed us." |
| **4-5/10** | Intellectual | Frustration | "It's infuriating they get away with this." |
| **2-3/10** | Generic | "It's wrong" | No personal stake |
| **0-1/10** | Detached | PSA tone | Clinical critique |

**Critical Rule:** CF1 (SETUP) should show ≥6/10 frustration to build toward CF3 takedown.

**Villain Naming:** CF2 MUST name specific entity (Big Pharma, diet industry, etc.)
