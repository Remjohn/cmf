## 1. The Specificity Ladder (The Offer)
**Question:** How concrete is the invitation?

| Score | Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **10/10** | **The Ticket** | Specific Date, Place, Price, and Outcome. | "Pack a bag. We leave Friday at dawn for the Alps." |
| **8-9/10** | **The Mission** | Clear Mission and Enemy. | "Join the team to fight this legislation." |
| **6-7/10** | **The Opportunity** | Vague but attractive offer. | "Come work with us." |
| **4-5/10** | **The Suggestion** | Passive advice. | "You should travel more." |
| **0-3/10** | **The Cloud** | Abstract concepts. | "Embrace change." |

**Validation Rule:** IF Cluster is **CA2 (The Call)**, Specificity MUST be ≥8/10.

## 2. Setup Validation (The Resistance)
**Question:** Does the Resistance justify the Leap?

| Score | Level | Metric |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **10/10** | **The Chasm** | Resistance is TANGIBLE and HIGH STAKES. (Loss of job, safety, reputation). |
| **7-9/10** | **The Wall** | Resistance is internal fear but clearly articulated. |
| **4-6/10** | **The Bump** | Resistance is minor inconvenience. |
| **0-3/10** | **The Flatline** | No resistance mentioned. |

**Validation Rule:** IF Cluster is **CA3 (Resistance)**, Score MUST be ≥7/10. A Call without Resistance is just an ad.
