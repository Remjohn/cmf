## 1. The Specificity Ladder (Consequences of Inaction)
**Question:** What exactly do I lose if I wait?

| Score | Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **10/10** | **The Irreversible Loss** | Losing something that cannot be replaced. | "I missed my daughter's first steps." |
| **8-9/10** | **The Compound Interest** | Hard numbers on lost growth. | "Every day I waited cost me $500." |
| **6-7/10** | **The Feeling** | Emotional weight. | "I felt heavy." |
| **4-5/10** | **The General** | "Time flies." |
| **0-3/10** | **The Cliche** | "It's now or never." |

**Validation Rule:** IF Cluster is **TC1 (Stagnation)**, Specificity MUST be ≥8/10 to prove the cost.

## 2. Setup Validation (The Stagnation Check)
**Question:** Does the viewer FEEL the time passing?

| Score | Level | Metric |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **10/10** | **The Time-Lapse** | Description of seasons/years passing while standing still. |
| **7-9/10** | **The Watcher** | Watching others succeed while stuck. |
| **4-6/10** | **The Procrastinator** | "I kept meaning to start." |
| **0-3/10** | **The Busy Work** | "I was researching." (Weak). |

**Validation Rule:** IF Cluster is **TC1**, Score MUST be ≥7/10.

## 3. Vulnerability Hierarchy (The Admission of Fear)
**Question:** Why did you really wait?

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **10/10** | **The Cowardice** | Admitting pure fear/weakness. "I was scared to fail." |
| **8-9/10** | **The Imposter** | "I didn't think I was good enough." |
| **6-7/10** | **The Confusion** | "I didn't know how." |
