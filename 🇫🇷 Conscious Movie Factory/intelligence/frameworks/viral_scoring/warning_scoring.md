# Warning Arc - Viral Trinity Scoring Rubric (ENHANCED)

**Arc Type:** The Warning (Cautionary Tale)
**Emotional Journey:** Normalcy → Signs → Crisis → Lesson
**Clusters:** W1 (Before), W2 (Ignored Signs), W3 (Crisis), W4 (Lesson)

---

## Scoring Philosophy

**Warning Arc** is "This could have been prevented." Urgency through regret.

**Viral Trinity Reframed:**
- **Surprise:** The TRIVIALITY of the early sign vs. SEVERITY of the consequence
- **Emotion:** Regret + Urgency. "Don't make my mistake."
- **Specificity:** The EXACT sign that was ignored. The timeline. The cost.

## 🆕 CONSEQUENCE SPECIFICITY LADDER (Principle A)

**Core Insight:** The cost must be EXACT to create urgency.

| Score | Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **10/10** | Symptom + Timeline + Cost | Complete cautionary tale | "I had headaches every Tuesday for 3 weeks. ignored them. Two years later, stage 3 cancer. $47K in medical bills and I'll never be the same." |
| **8-9/10** | Symptom + Cost | Named sign + severe outcome | "My ankles were swollen. That was my liver failing. I lost 3 years of my life to treatment." |
| **6-7/10** | Symptom Progression | Specific but cost unclear | "The bloating turned into chronic pain within 6 months." |
| **4-5/10** | General Escalation | Vague | "Small symptoms became big problems." |
| **2-3/10** | Generic Warning | "Don't ignore symptoms" | No specifics |
| **0-1/10** | PSA | Clinical advice | No personal story |

**Critical Rule:** W3 (CRISIS) cluster MUST score ≥8/10. The COST must be specific.

## 🆕 SETUP VALIDATION PROTOCOL (Principle B)

**Core Insight:** Symptom escalation is only surprising if dismissal was shown.

### Warning Arc Surprise Validation

**Common Surprise Type:** Triviality of symptom → severity of consequence

**Required Setup:** Normalcy/dismissal of symptom should be established

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Check for dismissal:** Did they mention ignoring/normalizing the symptom?
2. **Adjust score:** If no dismissal shown, reduce Surprise by 2 points

**Example:**
- Quote: "A little bloating became stage 3 cancer." (Surprise: 10/10)
- Validation: Did they mention dismissing the bloating as "just stress" or normal?
  - ✅ YES: Keep Surprise 10/10 (trivial → severe contrast)
  - ❌ NO: Reduce to Surprise 8/10 (consequence without context)

## 🆕 REGRET VULNERABILITY HIERARCHY (Principle C)

**Core Insight:** Warning requires PROTECTIVE urgency, not generic concern.

| Score | Level | Type | Example (Warning-Specific) |
|-------|-------|------|---------------------------|
| **10/10** | Desperate Protection | Urgency + body memory | "If I could go back and scream at myself, shake myself awake—I would. Please don't wait. I can still feel that hospital bed under me." |
| **8-9/10** | Self-Blame | Regret + responsibility | "I ignored every sign. I have to live with that." |
| **6-7/10** | Grief | Lost time | "I wish I'd listened sooner." |
| **4-5/10** | Concern | PSA tone, no personal pain | "It's important not to ignore symptoms." |
| **2-3/10** | Generic | "Be careful" | Generic advice |
| **0-1/10** | Detached | Clinical warning | No emotion |

**Critical Rule:** W4 (LESSON) should score ≥8/10 on urgency to motivate action.
