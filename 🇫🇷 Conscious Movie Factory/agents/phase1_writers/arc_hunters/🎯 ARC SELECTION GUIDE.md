## How to Use (DNA Sequencing Protocol)

1. **Define the FRAME** (What is this content about?)
2. **Identify the emotional journey** (e.g., Anxiety → Relief)
3. **Calculate Confidence Scores for top match:**
   - **High Confidence (>80%):** Matches 4/5 criteria (Structure + Emotion + Speaker + Keywords).
     - *Action:* Use Specialized Hunter exclusively.
   - **Medium Confidence (60-79%):** Matches 3/5 criteria.
     - *Action:* Use Specialized Hunter but verify the Quote Manifest manually.
   - **Low Confidence (<60%) or Mixed Signals:** Content is messy or multi-arc.
     - *Action:* Use "Mode A" (Premise Hunter V3 General Strategy) and manually shape the premises.

## Handling Ambiguity (The "Mixed Signal" Rule)

If the content is **60% Witness** and **40% Breakthrough**:
- **Protocol:** ALWAYS favor the specialized structure that fits the *Start* and *End* points.
- If it starts with Anxiety and ends with Clarity, treat it as **Breakthrough** (even if there are testimonial elements).
- If it starts before working with the coach and ends with results, treat it as **Witness** (even if there are anxiety moments).
- **Output:** State this rationale in the `strategy_brief.json`. "Primary Arc: Witness (65%). Secondary influences: Breakthrough."
