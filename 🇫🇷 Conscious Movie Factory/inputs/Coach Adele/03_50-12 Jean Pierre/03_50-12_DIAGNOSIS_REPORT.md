## Arc Detection
- **Recommended Arc:** The Witness
- **Confidence:** High

He explicitly validates the coach's method.

## Frame Statement
> "Jean-Pierre shares his transformation story with the community, showing how the holistic liver detox and the 'corpuscular approach' helped him overcome deep-seated generational traumas and disconnection, and achieve a state of 'renaissance', lightness, and true alignment with his local environment."

## Key Topics Identified
1. **Nature & Environment:** Living in the forest, aligning with local energy (Guadeloupe).
2. **The "Corpuscular" Body:** The missing piece of the puzzle; physical grounding vs esoteric knowledge.
3. **Detox as Renaissance:** "The caterpillar becoming a butterfly", cleaning the liver to clear the vision.
4. **Responsibility:** Self-love, making authentic choices, not blaming others.
