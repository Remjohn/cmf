### Template Match Logic
The available quotes are long, flowing, and contemplative. A "SPARSE" template (fewer cuts, longer holds) was chosen to respect the "Wise Elder" archetype of the protagonist. Forcing a JAB-JAB rhythm would destroy the ancestral gravitas.

### Bookend Logic
- **Start:** CONNECTION:POS (Ancestors/Meeting)
- **End:** RELATION:POS (Respect for Guide)
- **Status:** PASS (Thematic loop closed: Ancestors -> Guide).
