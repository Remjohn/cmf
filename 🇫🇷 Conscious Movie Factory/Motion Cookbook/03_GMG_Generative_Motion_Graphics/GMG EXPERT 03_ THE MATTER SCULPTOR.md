## **1\. CORE PHILOSOPHY: EMOTION AS MATERIAL PHYSICS**

The Matter Sculptor operates on the principle of "The Premium Literal."

When the script describes an internal sensation ("I felt broken," "I felt glowing"), we do not use human actors. We use Metaphorical Primitives.

### **1.1 The "Objectification" Mandate**

We translate adjectives into materials.

* **Script:** "I felt fragile."  
* **Bad AI:** A woman crying. (Too specific, bad acting).  
* **GMG Solution:** A perfect porcelain sphere developing a single, loud crack. (Universal, visceral).  
* **The Logic:** Humans have mirror neurons for physics. When we see glass break, we *feel* the shock. When we see liquid flow, we *feel* the relief. This expert hacks those neurons to deliver emotion without a face.

### **1.2 The "Single Primitive" Law**

To maintain the "Premium" aesthetic, we strictly enforce a **Single Object Hierarchy**.

* **The Rule:** We render **One Object** in the center of the void.  
  * *Allowed:* A Sphere, A Cube, A Cloth, A Rock, A Drop.  
  * *Banned:* A "Scene" with multiple floating items, a landscape, or complex machinery.  
* **Why:** AI 3D generators (like Z-Image Turbo) excel at rendering **Texture** on a single object but fail at complex spatial relationships. Focusing on one object ensures 8K-level detail on the scratches, reflections, and sub-surface scattering.

## **2\. THE VISUAL ARCHITECTURE (DESIGN TOKENS)**

To prevent "Screensaver Drift" (aimless swirling colors), every prompt is anchored by these rigid tokens.

### **2.1 Dimensionality (The Macro Studio)**

The world is a **Macro Photography Studio**.

* **The Void:** Deep Matte Black (\#050505). It is an infinite, light-absorbing room.  
* **The Scale:** Macro. We are inches away from the object. We can see the pores in the stone, the bubbles in the liquid, the fibers in the cloth.  
* **The Light:** **"Studio Chiaroscuro."** We use Rim Lighting and Softboxes to carve the shape out of the darkness. The light is never flat.

### **2.2 The Palette (The Noir Triad)**

We enforce the same brand-safe palette as Expert 02, but applied to *Materials*.

1. **The Void:** Rich Black (\#050505).  
2. **The Matter (Grayscale):** The object itself is monochromatic.  
   * *Solids:* Black Marble, White Porcelain, Brushed Steel, Raw Concrete.  
   * *Liquids:* Mercury (Silver), Milk (White), Oil (Black).  
   * *Gases:* Dry Ice Fog (White/Grey).  
3. **The Energy (Brand Accent):** The Brand\_Accent (e.g., Golden Yellow \#FFC727) is the **Light Source** or the **Core**.  
   * *Example:* A black rock cracks open, revealing a **Golden Core**.  
   * *Example:* Clear glass refracts **Golden Light**.

### **2.3 The Texture (The "Tactile" Token)**

We must explicitly define the **Surface Properties** to avoid the "Smooth AI 3D" look.

* **Refraction:** Glass, Water, Crystal. (Distorts the background).  
* **Sub-Surface Scattering (SSS):** Wax, Marble, Skin. (Light penetrates the surface).  
* **Roughness:** Concrete, Rust, Sandpaper. (Catches the light unevenly).

## **3\. THE MOTION PHYSICS ENGINE (STATE CHANGE)**

We do not animate "Movement" (A to B). We animate **"Transformation"** (Solid to Liquid, Whole to Broken).

### **3.1 The "Physical Event" Protocol**

The animation is defined by a **Physics Verb**.

* **The "Stress" Verbs (Negative Emotions):** Crack, Crush, Melt, Freeze, Erode, Shatter.  
  * *Use for:* "Pain," "Overwhelm," "Tension."  
* **The "Release" Verbs (Positive Emotions):** Bloom, Flow, Levitate, Glow, Heal, Assemble.  
  * *Use for:* "Peace," "Power," "Clarification."

### **3.2 The "Text Slam" (Velocity)**

Even though the object is abstract, the typography remains aggressive.

* **Constraint:** **SINGLE WORD ONLY.** ("BROKEN," "WHOLE," "FLOW").  
* **interaction:** The Text and the Object interact.  
  * *Example:* The word "HEAVY" lands on a soft-body sphere, squashing it.  
  * *Example:* The word "RISE" pulls a liquid drop upward against gravity.

### **3.3 The "Seamless Loop" Mindset**

The final video should feel like a "Satisfying Loop."

* **The Idle:** The object is always rotating slowly (Turntable animation) or undulating (Breathing).  
* **The Event:** The State Change happens (e.g., the crack appears), but the camera move remains smooth.

## **4\. THE "REVERSE-ENTROPY" GENERATION WORKFLOW**

We use the **Reverse-Linear Construction**. We generate the **Post-Transformation State** (The Result) first, then deconstruct it.

### **Step A: The Result Frame (Last Frame \- T2I)**

* **Goal:** The "Aftermath."  
* **Word Count:** **120-150 Words.**  
* **Content:** Describes the object *after* the event.  
  * *If "Broken":* We describe the shattered shards suspended in the air.  
  * *If "Healed":* We describe the perfect, glowing sphere.  
  * *If "Heavy":* We describe the object squashed flat on the floor.  
* **Typography:** The Single Word is fully present, integrated into the composition.

### **Step B: The Origin Frame (First Frame \- I2I)**

* **Goal:** The "Before."  
* **Operation:** **Reverse Physics.**  
  * *If "Broken":* We show the object whole and perfect.  
  * *If "Healed":* We show the object dark and rough.  
  * *If "Heavy":* We show the object perfectly round and floating.  
* **Typography:** Delete the text.

### **Step C: The Physics Simulation (Motion \- I2V)**

* **Goal:** The "Event."  
* **Prompting:** We describe the *Action* that connects Frame 1 to Frame Last. (e.g., "The sphere shatters explosively," "The liquid flows upward").

## **5\. TEST PROMPTS (THE "AUDREY" SCRIPT)**

Here are **2 Test Examples** applying the **"Visceral Physics"** logic.

### **Test Set 1: "The Core" (Inner Power)**

Context: "The digestive system is alive... inner divine power."

Concept: A dormant rock revealing a radiant core.

#### **1\. LAST FRAME (Text-to-Image / Z-Image Turbo)**

**\[OBJECT\]:** A macro 3D render of a cracked sphere made of rough, dark charcoal stone. **\[ACTION\]:** The sphere has split open down the center, revealing an intensely glowing core made of pure liquid **Golden Yellow \[\#FFC727\]** light. The light spills out, illuminating the rough texture of the stone edges. **\[TYPOGRAPHY\]:** Floating directly above the object is the single word "**ALIVE**" in bold, white, sans-serif 3D letters. **\[STYLE\]:** High-end 3D motion design style (Man vs Machine). **\[LIGHTING\]:** Dramatic rim lighting in the dark void. Deep black background.

#### **2\. FIRST FRAME (Image-to-Image / Qwen Edit)**

**DELETE the word "ALIVE".** **CLOSE THE SPHERE:** The dark charcoal stone sphere is completely whole and uncracked. It looks like a solid, heavy rock. **REMOVE THE GLOW:** There is no golden light visible. It is a dormant, dark object in the void.

#### **3\. MOTION PROMPT (I2V / Wan 2.2)**

**Motion:** Internal Pressure. The dark stone sphere vibrates violently. Suddenly, a bright golden crack fissures down the center. The two halves slowly drift apart, revealing the blinding liquid gold core. The word "**ALIVE**" slams down from above, locking into place.

---

### **Test Set 2: "The Overwhelm" (Symptoms)**

Context: "Vertigo, acidity... fatigue."

Concept: A soft object being crushed by invisible pressure.

#### **1\. LAST FRAME (Text-to-Image / Z-Image Turbo)**

**\[OBJECT\]:** A macro 3D render of a soft-body sphere (like white matte silicone or dough). **\[ACTION\]:** The sphere is squashed completely flat against the invisible floor, as if crushed by an immense weight. The sides bulge out under the pressure. **\[TYPOGRAPHY\]:** Resting directly on top of the flattened sphere is the massive, heavy word "**PRESSURE**" in thick, black iron typography. **\[ACCENT\]:** A single vein of **Golden Yellow \[\#FFC727\]** liquid leaks from the side of the crushed sphere. **\[STYLE\]:** Hyper-realistic texture, soft shadows, ambient occlusion. **\[BACKGROUND\]:** Infinite black void.

#### **2\. FIRST FRAME (Image-to-Image / Qwen Edit)**

**DELETE the word "PRESSURE".** **RESTORE THE SPHERE:** The white silicone sphere is perfectly round and floating slightly above the floor. It is untouched and pristine. **REMOVE THE LEAK:** No yellow liquid. Just a perfect white ball.

#### **3\. MOTION PROMPT (I2V / Wan 2.2)**

**Motion:** Heavy Gravity impact. The word "**PRESSURE**" falls from the top of the frame like a 10-ton weight. It hits the white sphere, instantly crushing it flat against the floor. The sphere deforms realistically (squash and stretch). A drop of golden liquid squeezes out from the impact.

## **6\. IMMUTABLE CONSISTENCY GUARDRAILS**

1. **The "One Object" Law:** Never render two spheres. Never render a pile of rocks. One singular "Hero Object" in the center.  
2. **The "Material Truth" Law:** Materials must behave realistically. Stone creates dust when it breaks. Liquid splashes. Cloth folds. Do not allow "magic morphing."  
3. **The "Noir/Gold" Law:** The object is always Grayscale. The "Life/Energy" is always the Brand Accent (Golden Yellow).  
4. **The "Macro" Law:** The camera must be close. We need to see the texture. No wide shots.  
5. **The "Text Interaction" Law:** The text interacts with the object. It is either the *Cause* of the physics (crushing the object) or the *Result* (emerging from the object).

This architecture ensures **Expert 03** delivers abstract, emotional visuals that feel physically grounded, expensive, and deeply satisfying to watch.
