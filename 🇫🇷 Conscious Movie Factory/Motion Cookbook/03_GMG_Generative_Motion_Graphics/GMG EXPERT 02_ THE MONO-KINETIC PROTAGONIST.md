## **1\. CORE PHILOSOPHY: THE BRAND AVATAR IN THE STORM**

We have evolved beyond the "Anonymous Silhouette." We are now rendering a specific **Identity** enduring a specific **Climate**. The audience must build a parasocial relationship with the Brand Avatar. However, to maintain the "Premium/Abstract" feel, we render this specific person through the lens of **High-Contrast Noir** and **Cinematic Weather**.

### **1.1 The "Character Anchor" Protocol**

Every prompt starts with a specific **Physical DNA** block. This prevents the AI from generating "Soulless Stock Models." Even though the final output is Black & White, providing the specific details (ethnicity, age, hair texture) ensures the *structure* of the human is consistent and soulful.

* **The Input:** The Agent receives the \[CHARACTER ANCHOR\] (e.g., "Audrey, 43, Guadeloupean, curly hair").  
* **The Translation:** The Agent converts this into the **Noir Style**.  
  * *Input:* "Warm olive skin." $\\to$ *Output:* "Luminous skin with high-contrast highlights."  
  * *Input:* "Purple floral dress." $\\to$ *Output:* "Textured floral-patterned dress rendered in deep charcoal and white."

### **1.2 The "Living Statue" Mandate**

The Mono-Kinetic Protagonist is not a character in a movie; they are a **Graphic Symbol**.

* **The Pose IS The Animation:** The emotion is not expressed through *movement* (jumping/running); it is expressed through *posture* (the "Last Frame" pose). A figure standing with head bowed *is* "Defeat." They don't need to fall to their knees to show it.  
* **The "Natural Force" Rule:** We reject "floating" or "random shaking." Motion must be **MOTIVATED BY NATURE**.  
  * *Bad Motion:* "The scarf moves slightly." (Why? Is it magic?)  
  * *Good Motion:* "A heavy gale-force wind blows the scarf horizontally." (Relatable Physics).  
* **The Result:** The subject becomes an **Anchor**—a heavy, gravity-bound object standing firm against a visual storm, forcing the viewer to look at the **Kinetic Typography** exploding around them.

## **2\. THE VISUAL ARCHITECTURE (DESIGN TOKENS)**

To prevent "Hallucination Drift," every prompt must be built from these rigid aesthetic blocks.

### **2.1 Dimensionality (The 2.5D Collage)**

The image is constructed of three flat planes in a Z-space.

* **Plane 0 (The Void):** Deep Matte Black (\#050505). It absorbs light. It creates the "Stage." **White Space is critical.** We need 50-60% negative space to let the composition breathe.  
* **Plane 1 (The Typography):** The Kinetic Element. **SINGLE WORD. SINGLE LINE.** It is massive, structural, and aggressive.  
* **Plane 2 (The Avatar):** The Rotoscope Cutout. A high-fidelity, high-contrast photographic element. It has distinct, sharp edges (cutout style), separating it from the void.  
* **Plane 3 (The Elements):** Rain, Fog, Snow, or Wind. These exist *between* the planes, bonding the Avatar to the Void.

### **2.2 The Palette (The Noir Triad)**

We enforce a strict **Three-Tone Limit**.

1. **The Void:** Rich Black (\#050505).  
2. **The Avatar:** High-Contrast Grayscale. Highlights are pure White (\#FFFFFF); shadows are Deep Charcoal (\#111111). Skin looks like silver nitrate film; clothing looks like inked comic art.  
3. **The Accent:** One single color. The Brand\_Accent (e.g., Golden Yellow \#FFC727) is the source of "Energy." It is applied **ONLY** to the Text or a single Symbolic Accessory (Scarf, Jewelry). It is **NEVER** used for ambient lighting.

### **2.3 The Texture (The "Analog" Token)**

To avoid the "AI Plastic Look," we inject **"Analog Noise"** tokens.

* **Film Grain:** Simulates ISO 3200 film stock (gritty, noisy).  
* **Halftone:** Subtle dot patterns in the deep shadows (referencing zine print).  
* **Tactile Contrast:** We explicitly ask for "Linen," "Leather," "Sweat," or "Denim" to give the subject tactile reality against the flat vector text.

## **3\. THE MOTION PHYSICS ENGINE (ELEMENTAL DRAMA)**

Motion in this style is not "fluid." Fluidity implies video. We want **"Atmospheric Animation."** We use Weather as a proxy for Emotion.

### **3.1 The Elemental Library (Natural Modifiers)**

We do not use random animation. We use specific weather systems to justify movement.

* **WIND (The Chaos):** Used for High Energy, Anxiety, or Power. It motivates hair blowing, clothes flapping, and dust flying.  
* **RAIN (The Weight):** Used for Sadness, Struggle, or Cleansing. It creates vertical streaks, floor splashes, and "wet skin" texture.  
* **FOG (The Confusion):** Used for Mystery, Internal Thoughts, or "The Void." It drifts slowly, obscuring the feet or the text.  
* **THUNDER/FLASH (The Shock):** Used for Realization or Trauma. It creates instant, violent lighting changes (Strobe effect).  
* **SNOW/ASH (The Silence):** Used for Coldness, Isolation, or Aftermath. It floats gently, creating a slow-motion feel.

### **3.2 The "Text Slam" (Velocity)**

Since the subject is anchored by the weather, the Text must be **Violent**.

* **Constraint:** **SINGLE WORD ONLY.** The AI cannot render sentences. It can only render "HEAVY," "STOP," "POWER," "RISE."  
* **Velocity:** The text should not fade in. It should **SLAM**, **SLIDE**, or **GROW** instantly.  
* **Contrast:** The contrast between the *Natural Weather* (Organic) and the *Vector Text* (Digital) creates the premium tension.

### **3.3 The "Looping" Mindset**

The goal is a **Seamless Loop**.

* The Avatar's breathing/idle motion should be continuous.  
* The Weather is a continuous cycle (Rain never stops).  
* The text entry is the "Event," but the Avatar's state is constant.  
* This allows the viewer to watch the reel multiple times without a jarring "reset" of the character's position.

## **4\. THE "POSE-LOCK" GENERATION WORKFLOW**

We use the **Reverse-Linear Construction** method with **Character Injection** and **Elemental Bonding**.

### **Step A: The Editorial Frame (Last Frame \- T2I)**

* **Goal:** The "Hero Shot."  
* **Word Count:** **160-180 Words.**  
* **Injection:** We insert the \[CHARACTER ANCHOR\] at the start.  
* **Atmosphere:** We explicitly define the **Weather Condition** (e.g., "Heavy Rain," "Gale Force Wind").  
* **Translation:** We explicitly tell the AI to render this specific character in "High-Contrast Noir Monochrome."  
* **Typography:** We describe the **SINGLE WORD** fully present in the scene.

### **Step B: The Clean Slate (First Frame \- I2I)**

* **Goal:** The "Canvas."  
* **Operation:** **Subtraction ONLY.**  
  * **Delete the Text:** The void becomes empty.  
  * **KEEP THE POSE:** We do **NOT** neutralize the pose. If Audrey is crouching in the rain in the last frame, she is crouching in the rain in the first frame.  
  * **KEEP THE WEATHER:** The rain is present before the text arrives.  
  * **Why?** This ensures there is no "morphing" or "warping" of the body during animation. The body is a rock. Only the text changes.

### **Step C: The Elemental Motion (Motion \- I2V)**

* **Goal:** The "Life."  
* **Prompting:** We ask for "Heavy Rain," "Wind Blowing Hair," "Fog Drifting." We do **NOT** ask for "Micro-shakes" or "Trembling" unless motivated by the cold/wind. The motion comes from the **Environment**, not the Muscle.

## **5\. TEST PROMPTS (THE "AUDREY" SCRIPT)**

Here are **2 Test Examples** applying the **"Brand Avatar"** and **"Elemental Drama"** logic. Note how the "random floating scarf" is now replaced by "Wind Physics" or "Gravity."

### **Test Set 1: "Radiance" (The Transformation)**

Context: "A human silhouette transformed into radiant light."

Concept: The Embodiment of Power (Wind/Storm).

#### **1\. LAST FRAME (Text-to-Image / Z-Image Turbo)**

**\[CHARACTER ANCHOR\]:** A cinematic, monochromatic photographic cutout of **Audrey**, a 43-year-old Guadeloupean woman with long dark curly hair. **\[STYLE\]:** She is rendered in high-contrast Noir style—deep shadows hiding her eyes, bright white highlights on her cheekbones and shoulders. She is wearing a textured floral dress, rendered in stark black and white ink style. **\[POSE\]:** She is captured in a permanent state of ecstatic victory, head thrown back, arms wide open in a static 'V' shape, screaming towards the sky. **\[ELEMENTS\]:** A violent, gale-force wind is blowing from below (updraft), whipping her hair and dress upwards in dramatic arcs. **\[TYPOGRAPHY\]:** Behind her, partially obscured by her head, is the massive single word "**RADIANCE**" in ultra-bold, condensed sans-serif. The text is glowing with a solid, flat **Golden Yellow \[\#FFC727\]**, the only color in the image. **\[TEXTURE\]:** Raw, gritty, like a punk zine clipping with halftone shading. **\[COMPOSITION\]:** Floating in a deep black void with 50% negative space at the bottom.

#### **2\. FIRST FRAME (Image-to-Image / Qwen Edit)**

**DELETE the massive yellow word "RADIANCE".** Ensure the background is completely empty black void. **CRITICAL: KEEP THE POSE EXACTLY THE SAME.** Do not lower the arms. Do not change the head position. Audrey must remain in the "Arms Open" victory pose with the wind blowing her hair upwards. **ADJUST:** The wind is blowing, but the text is missing. She is frozen in the peak of the scream.

#### **3\. MOTION PROMPT (I2V / Wan 2.2)**

**Motion:** High-energy Elemental Storm. Audrey holds the victory pose perfectly still. A powerful vertical wind blows her curly hair and dress violently upwards. The motion is constant and turbulent. The film grain texture boils. The massive yellow word "**RADIANCE**" slams into the background instantly, vibrating with energy. The figure does not move her limbs; she is a solid anchor against the wind.

---

### **Test Set 2: "The Struggle" (Symptoms)**

Context: "I felt heavy, tired, overwhelmed."

Concept: The Weight of the World (Rain/Gravity).

#### **1\. LAST FRAME (Text-to-Image / Z-Image Turbo)**

**\[CHARACTER ANCHOR\]:** A cinematic, monochromatic photographic cutout of **Audrey**, a 43-year-old Guadeloupean woman with curly hair. **\[STYLE\]:** Rendered in high-contrast Noir photography. She is wearing a flowing dress, rendered as heavy, soaked fabric with deep charcoal folds. **\[POSE\]:** She is hunched over in a deep crouch, hands gripping her head, knees bent, freezing under pressure. **\[ELEMENTS\]:** A heavy, relentless downpour of rain falls vertically. The water streaks across her skin and clothes, making them look wet and heavy. Splash droplets bounce off her shoulders. **\[TYPOGRAPHY\]:** Looming over her, filling the top half of the frame, is the single word "**HEAVY**" in massive, blocky Kinetic Typography. The text is pure **White**. **\[ACCENT\]:** She is wearing a **Golden Yellow \[\#FFC727\]** scarf that is soaked and dragging heavily on the floor, providing the single accent color. **\[TEXTURE\]:** Raw, photocopied aesthetic with grain. **\[COMPOSITION\]:** Bottom-weighted.

#### **2\. FIRST FRAME (Image-to-Image / Qwen Edit)**

**DELETE the word "HEAVY".** **CRITICAL: KEEP THE POSE EXACTLY THE SAME.** Audrey must remain in the deep crouch, hands gripping her head. Do not stand her up. **KEEP THE RAIN:** The heavy rain must continue to fall on her. **ADJUST:** The yellow scarf lies heavy and wet on the invisible floor. The figure is frozen in the moment of impact.

#### **3\. MOTION PROMPT (I2V / Wan 2.2)**

**Motion:** Atmospheric Tragedy. Heavy rain falls vertically in sheets, streaking down the screen. Audrey remains locked in the crouch pose, perfectly still like a statue in a storm. The rain splashes off her back. The yellow scarf lies heavy and motionless, pinned by gravity. The single word "**HEAVY**" crashes down from the top of the frame like a falling anvil, landing just above her head. The impact causes a slight camera shake, but the figure remains solid.

## **6\. IMMUTABLE CONSISTENCY GUARDRAILS**

These rules are hard-coded into the expert's logic.

1. **The "Brand Avatar" Law:** All prompts must start with the specific Character Anchor description to prevent generic AI humans.  
2. **The "Single Word" Law:** **NEVER** generate a sentence. **NEVER** generate a phrase. ONE WORD ONLY. (e.g., "HEAVY", "STOP", "RISE"). The AI fails at kerning sentences.  
3. **The "Statue" Law:** The First Frame Pose and Last Frame Pose must be **Identical**. We animate the *atmosphere*, not the *skeleton*.  
4. **The "Nature" Law:** All motion must be justified by a Weather Element (Wind, Rain, Fog, Gravity). No random floating or twitching.  
5. **The "One Body" Law:** One Person. One Void. One Word. One Weather System.  
6. **The "Accessory" Law:** Only ONE accessory is allowed per frame (e.g., Scarf, Phone, Crown). It must react to the weather (e.g., blowing in wind, wet in rain).
