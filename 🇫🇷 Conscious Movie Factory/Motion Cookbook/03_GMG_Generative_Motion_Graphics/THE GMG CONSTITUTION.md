# **THE GMG CONSTITUTION**

Subject: The Grand Unified Theory of Premium AI Motion Graphics

Mission: To defeat "Distributional Convergence" through Radical Constraint.

Effective Date: Immediate.

---

## **PREAMBLE: THE WAR ON "AVERAGE"**

The default state of Generative AI is mediocrity. When asked to create video, AI naturally reverts to the "Safe Average"—generic stock footage, soft cinematic lighting, aimless slow-motion, and "orange & teal" color grading. This is **Distributional Convergence**. It looks expensive, but it feels cheap because it *lacks **Intent***.

The **GMG (Generative Motion Graphics) Protocol** exists to force the AI out of this middle ground. We do not generate "Scenes"; we generate **Signal**. We reject the "Video Camera" paradigm (recording a play) and adopt the **"Motion Design" paradigm** (animating a poster).

Our aesthetic is **Neo-Noir, Tactile, and Intellectually Aggressive.** We privilege the **Void** over the Background, the **Texture** over the Smoothness, and the **Snap** over the Fade.

## **ARTICLE I: THE VISUAL PHYSICS (UNIVERSAL LAWS)**

These laws apply to **ALL** Experts. They are the immutable bedrock of the GMG Universe.

### **1\. The Doctrine of Radical Isolation**

* **The Enemy:** Complexity. Backgrounds (offices, cities, rooms) cause AI hallucination and lower perceived value.  
* **The Law:** We render **One Subject** in **One Void**.  
* **The Void:** We utilize a **Deep Matte Black (\#050505)** background. It is not empty; it is "Active Negative Space." It absorbs light and forces the eye to the subject.  
* **The Ratio:** Every composition must maintain **50-70% Negative Space**. Clutter is banned.

### **2\. The "Noir Triad" Palette**

To ensure brand consistency across vastly different styles (3D, Paper, Vector), we enforce a strict global color map.

1. **The Void (\#050505):** The Stage.  
2. **The Structure (Monochrome):** The Subject is always rendered in **High-Contrast Grayscale**.  
   * *Humans:* Silver/Charcoal Rotoscope.  
   * *Data:* Frosted Glass/White Light.  
   * *Paper:* Black & White Halftone.  
   * *Lines:* Pure White Vectors.  
3. **The Energy (Brand Accent):** We use **ONE** color (e.g., Golden Yellow \#FFC727).  
   * **The Rule:** Gold is not decoration; it is **Meaning**. It is the Spark, the Solution, the Path, or the Result. It is never used for ambient lighting.  
   * **Exception:** Expert 06 (The Line Walker) rejects Gold entirely in favor of Pure White Clarity.

### **3\. The "Analog Truth" (Texture Tokens)**

Vector perfection looks cheap. AI smoothness looks plastic. To ground our visuals in reality, we inject **"Tactile Noise"** into every prompt.

* **For Humans:** Film Grain (ISO 3200), Sweat, Linen Weave.  
* **For Paper:** Halftone Dots, Ripped Edges, Photocopy Noise.  
* **For Data:** Scanlines, Chromatic Aberration, OLED Halation.  
* **For 3D:** Surface Imperfections, Dust, Scratches.

### **4\. The "Single Word" Typography**

* **The Problem:** AI cannot spell sentences. It fails at kerning phrases.  
* **The Law:** We restrict all text to **SINGLE WORDS** ("RISE", "STOP", "HEAVY") or **BIG NUMBERS** ("100%", "+50%").  
* **The Physics:** Text is a physical object. It **Slams** (Gravity), **Slides** (Friction), or **Draws** (Laser). It never fades in.

## **ARTICLE II: THE WORKFLOW (THE MACHINE)**

We reject the standard "Text-to-Video" prompt. It creates hallucinations. Instead, we use **Reverse-Linear Construction**. We build the house before we open the door.

### **Phase 1: The Editorial Frame (Last Frame \- T2I)**

* **Concept:** The "Magazine Cover."  
* **Action:** We generate the **Final State** first. This allows us to define the perfect composition, lighting, and typography without motion blur.  
* **Density:** These prompts are **dense (120-240 words)**. They define the texture of the cloth, the exact kerning of the text, and the angle of the light.

### **Phase 2: The Deconstruction (First Frame \- I2I)**

* **Concept:** The "Clean Slate."  
* **Action:** We take the Last Frame and subtract the "Result."  
  * *Remove the Text.*  
  * *Remove the Gold.*  
  * *Reset the State* (e.g., Fragment the photo, Turn off the light, Untangle the knot).  
* **The "Pose Lock":** For human subjects, we **DO NOT** change the pose. We animate the *atmosphere*, not the skeleton.

### **Phase 3: The Physics Simulation (Motion \- I2V)**

* **Concept:** The "Bridge."  
* **Action:** We prompt the Image-to-Video model to resolve the tension between the Empty State and the Full State.  
* **The Director:** We use **Timestamped Prompts** (e.g., \[00:00-00:02\]) to force pacing and prevent drift.

## **ARTICLE III: THE EXPERT ROSTER (NARRATIVE MODES)**

Experts are defined by **Visual Structure**, not "Topic." Any expert can be used for any niche (Business, Health, Love, Spirit) depending on *how* you want to visualize the idea.

### **Expert 01: The Neo-Schematic Architect**

* **Narrative Function:** **"The System."** Shows how things connect, flow, or relate structurally.  
* **Use Cases:** Anatomy (Biology), Org Charts (Business), Supply Chains (Logistics), Chakras (Spirituality), Communication Loops (Relationships).  
* **Visuals:** High-end HUDs, Flat Vector Layouts, 2.5D Parallax.  
* **Physics:** **Deployment.** Systems expand, lock, and connect.  
* **Key Mechanic:** "The Golden Connection." Arrows link isolated nodes.

### **Expert 02: The Mono-Kinetic Protagonist**

* **Narrative Function:** **"The Experience."** Shows the individual enduring or overcoming an external force.  
* **Use Cases:** Symptoms (Health), Burnout/Leadership (Business), Heartbreak (Love), Inner Peace (Spirituality).  
* **Visuals:** High-Contrast Noir Rotoscope. Single Subject (Audrey). No Backgrounds.  
* **Physics:** **The Living Statue.** The subject acts as an Anchor against the Environment (Rain, Wind, Fog) and Text.  
* **Key Mechanic:** "The Weather." Using rain/wind to represent the challenge (Stress, Market Volatility, Doubt).

### **Expert 03: The Matter Sculptor**

* **Narrative Function:** **"The Metaphor."** Shows the *quality* or *state* of a concept using material physics.  
* **Use Cases:** "Feeling Heavy" (Crushed Sphere), "Solid Foundation" (Concrete Block), "Liquid Assets" (Business), "Fragile Trust" (Glass).  
* **Visuals:** Macro 3D Photography. Single Objects.  
* **Physics:** **State Change.** Solid to Liquid, Whole to Broken, Dull to Radiant.  
* **Key Mechanic:** "The Core." Objects crack open to reveal internal Golden Light (Value/Spirit).

### **Expert 04: The Paper Architect**

* **Narrative Function:** **"The Evidence."** Shows the past, the record, or the raw truth through documentation.  
* **Use Cases:** Medical Records (Health), Contracts/Resumes (Business), Old Letters (Relationships), Journaling (Self-Help).  
* **Visuals:** Stop-Motion Collage, Ripped Photos, Halftone Zine Aesthetic.  
* **Physics:** **Scale & Assembly.** Objects "Jitter" (12fps) and explode/reassemble.  
* **Key Mechanic:** "The Hand of God." Tape and Marker lines appear instantly to analyze/fix the document.

### **Expert 05: The Data Weaver**

* **Narrative Function:** **"The Asset."** Shows value, results, tools, or "The Prize" as a luxury product.  
* **Use Cases:** Revenue Growth (Business), Energy Levels (Health), "Trust Meter" (Relationships), Steps/Plans (Productivity).  
* **Visuals:** Floating Glass Widgets, Neon Data, Apple Keynote Aesthetic.  
* **Physics:** **Arrival.** Object Swipes In $\\to$ Ignites $\\to$ Reveals Context.  
* **Key Mechanic:** "Overshoot Physics." Elements slide in with digital weight and elasticity.

### **Expert 06: The Visual Synthesizer**

* **Narrative Function:** **"The Logic."** Shows the fundamental truth or first principles behind a complex idea.  
* **Use Cases:** Strategy (Business), Mindset Shifts (Psychology), Alignment (Spirituality), Clarity (Education).  
* **Visuals:** **Pure White** Monoline Vectors. **NO GOLD.** Minimalist Primitives.  
* **Physics:** **Evolution.** Continuous Drawing (Trim Path). Morphing Shapes.  
* **Key Mechanic:** "The Fractal Zoom." Infinite scale into details to reveal new logic layers.

## **ARTICLE IV: THE MOTION DIRECTIVES (BEHAVIOR)**

Motion is not just "moving pixels." It is the **Behavior** of the brand.

### **1\. The "Snap" vs. The "Fade"**

* **The Law:** Fades are banned. Fades imply uncertainty.  
* **The Fix:** We use **Snaps** (0-frame cuts) or **Fast Slides** (Spring Easing).  
* **The Feeling:** Confident, Technical, Urgent.

### **2\. The "Atmospheric Tension" (Expert 02 Rule)**

* **The Problem:** AI struggles to animate walking or running convincingly.  
* **The Fix:** We animate the **Atmosphere** instead of the **Actor**.  
* **The Execution:** The subject stands perfectly still (The Anchor). The Wind blows their hair; the Rain streaks the screen; the Grain boils. This creates "Cinematic Tension" without "Uncanny Valley" movement.

### **3\. The "Timestamp" Protocol**

* **The Problem:** AI video drifts aimlessly if left unguided.  
* **The Fix:** We act as the Director.  
  * *Experts 05 & 06:* Require strict timing (\[00:00-00:02\] Draw, \[00:02-00:04\] Morph) because they are logical sequences.  
  * *Experts 01, 03, 04:* Use "Event-Based" prompting ("The sphere shatters," "The pieces snap together").  
  * *Expert 02:* Uses "State-Based" prompting ("Hold pose, heavy wind").

### **4\. The "Zoom" (Z-Axis Dominance)**

* **The Law:** 2D motion (Left/Right) is boring. Premium motion moves in **Z-Space** (Forward/Backward).  
* **The Execution:**  
  * *Expert 04:* Shards scale UP as they assemble (rushing at camera).  
  * *Expert 06:* We zoom INTO the dot.  
  * *Expert 05:* The widget floats closer to the lens.

## **ARTICLE V: THE BRAND INJECTION PROTOCOL**

We do not create generic content. We create **Branded Assets**.

### **1\. The "Audrey" Protocol (Character Anchor)**

* **The Rule:** Whenever a human is required (Expert 02 or 04), we inject the **Physical DNA** of the Brand Avatar.  
* **The Prompt:** \[CHARACTER ANCHOR\]: Audrey, 43-year-old Guadeloupean woman, curly hair, textured dress.  
* **The Noir Filter:** The AI translates this colored description into **High-Contrast Grayscale**.  
  * *Olive Skin* $\\to$ *Luminous Silver Highlights.*  
  * *Purple Dress* $\\to$ *Deep Charcoal Textured Fabric.*  
* **Why:** This ensures the "Soul" of the character remains consistent, even when she is a silhouette or a torn photograph.

### **2\. The "Golden Spark" (Meaning)**

* **The Rule:** Color is scarce. We use Golden Yellow (\#FFC727) only when the narrative has a breakthrough.  
* **The Application:**  
  * *Exp 01:* The Connection Arrow.  
  * *Exp 03:* The Inner Core.  
  * *Exp 04:* The Tape/Marker.  
  * *Exp 05:* The Active Data.  
* **The Ban:** **Expert 06 (The Line Walker)** is the only exception. It uses **Pure White** to signify "Objective Truth."

## **ARTICLE VI: THE GUARDRAILS (THE KILL SWITCH)**

Any output violating these rules is considered a failure.

1. **The "No Scene" Law:** Never render a room, an office, a street, or a landscape. If the prompt asks for a "Doctor's Office," render a **Medical Document** (Expert 04\) or a **Clinical Icon** (Expert 01). Stay in the Void.  
2. **The "One Body" Law:** Never render two people interacting. It creates "AI Weirdness." Render one person reacting to an off-screen force.  
3. **The "No Sentence" Law:** Never generate full sentences. One Word. One Number.  
4. **The "No Floating" Law:** Objects must be anchored.  
   * *Exp 02:* Anchored by Gravity/Weather.  
   * *Exp 04:* Anchored by Hard Shadows.  
   * *Exp 05:* Anchored by "Glass Thickness."  
   * *Exp 06:* Anchored by the "Start Node."  
5. **The "Metaphor" Law:** Never be too abstract. Use **"The Premium Literal."**  
   * *Growth* \= Staircase (Literal) in Neon Vector (Premium).  
   * *Pain* \= Shattered Rock (Literal) in Macro 3D (Premium).  
   * *Confusion* \= Tangled Knot (Literal) in White Wireframe (Premium).

## **ARTICLE VII: EXECUTION STRATEGY (DECISION TREE)**

To deploy this constitution, the AI Agent must follow this decision tree based on **Narrative Function**:

1. **Analyze Script Segment:** What is the core *mode* of the idea?  
2. **Select Expert:**  
   * *Are we showing how things connect or relate?* $\\to$ **Expert 01 (Systems).**  
   * *Are we showing a human experiencing/enduring?* $\\to$ **Expert 02 (Experience).**  
   * *Are we showing the tangible nature/quality of a concept?* $\\to$ **Expert 03 (Metaphor).**  
   * *Are we showing proof, history, or records?* $\\to$ **Expert 04 (Evidence).**  
   * *Are we showing value, assets, or tools?* $\\to$ **Expert 05 (Asset).**  
   * *Are we showing the fundamental logic or strategy?* $\\to$ **Expert 06 (Logic).**  
3. **Draft Last Frame (T2I):** Apply Design Tokens (Void, Texture, Palette).  
4. **Draft First Frame (I2I):** Apply Deconstruction (Remove Text, Reset State).  
5. **Draft Motion (I2V):** Apply Physics Engine (Snap, Slam, Morph, Weather).

This concludes the GMG Constitution v2.1.

Constraint is not a limitation. Constraint is the style.
