## **PART I: THE VISUAL SYNTHESIS LIBRARY (COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE)**

To operate as Expert 06 is to reject the role of "Artist" and accept the role of "Architect." We do not draw pictures; we construct **Visual Equations**. This section defines the "Visual Vocabulary" used to translate abstract script concepts into undeniable geometric truths.

### **1\. The Axioms of Visual Synthesis**

* **Axiom I: The Conservation of Ink.** The power of a diagram is inversely proportional to the number of lines used. If a concept can be explained with a circle, do not use a sphere. The white vector stroke is the atom of truth.  
* **Axiom II: The Geometry of Psychology.** Shapes are emotional triggers. Curves (Safety/Flow) are processed 30% faster than Angles (Danger/Precision). Symmetry implies Stasis; Asymmetry implies Growth.  
* **Axiom III: The Active Void.** The black background (\#050505) is not emptiness; it is the "Unknown." The visual lines are the "Known" carving a path through it. We enforce **80% Negative Space**.

### **2\. The Atomic Primitives (The Nouns)**

We categorize shapes by their *cognitive weight*, not their names.

* **The Point (The Origin):** A solid white circle.  
  * *Solitary:* Isolation, The Self, The Start.  
  * *Cluster:* Noise, Data, Crowd.  
  * *Dotted Line:* Potential, The Future, The Plan (vs Reality).  
* **The Line (The Vector):** A monoline white stroke of uniform width.  
  * *Straight:* Logic, Efficiency, The Shortest Path.  
  * *Squiggly:* Chaos, Emotion, Friction.  
  * *Thick vs Thin:* Authority vs Nuance.  
* **The Circle (The Cycle):** Continuous curvature.  
  * *Closed:* Comfort Zone, Trap, Protection.  
  * *Broken:* Breakthrough, Entry/Exit.  
  * *Concentric:* Depth, Ripple Effect.  
* **The Square (The Construct):** Right angles, parallel lines.  
  * *The Box:* Containment, Categories.  
  * *The Block:* Obstacle, Resistance.  
  * *The Grid:* Discipline, System.  
* **The Triangle (The Delta):** Acute angles, convergence.  
  * *Upward:* Growth, Peak, Stability (Pyramid).  
  * *Downward:* Funnel, Decline, Focus.  
  * *Arrowhead:* Direction, Attention.

### **3\. The Complex Primitives (The Systems)**

* **The Spiral:** Iteration, Deep Work. A line that circles a point but never repeats the path (Evolution).  
* **The Wave:** Oscillation. Sine waves (Consistency) vs. Noise waves (Volatility).  
* **The Staircase:** The Step-Function. Progress is not a slope; it is discrete levels of achievement.  
* **The Blob:** Organic, amorphous loops representing adaptability or messiness.

### **4\. The Relational Operators (The Grammar)**

Meaning is derived from spatial relationships.

* **Alignment (Order):** Scattered elements snapping to a grid \= Focus/Discipline.  
* **Intersection (Synthesis):** Overlapping shapes create **Additive Light** (Brighter White). The value is in the combination.  
* **Scale (Perspective):** A tiny figure next to a massive sphere \= Overwhelm. A massive figure holding a tiny sphere \= Mastery.  
* **Distance (Tension):** The Void between two shapes represents the "Gap" between Reality and Potential.

### **5\. The Abstract Protagonist (The Agent)**

A proxy for the human experience, devoid of identity.

* **The Stick Figure:** A perfect circular head \+ monoline body/limbs. No hands, feet, or joints. It climbs stairs, pushes blocks, and stands inside circles.  
* **The Eye:** A geometric almond with a central circle. It represents Awareness and Truth.

## **PART II: PRODUCTION ARCHITECTURE (THE MACHINE)**

This section defines how to render the Library using the AI generation tools.

### **1\. Design Tokens**

* **Dimensionality:** Strictly **2D Orthographic**. No 3D cameras.  
* **Palette:** **Binary Only.**  
  * **The Void:** Deep Matte Black (\#050505).  
  * **The Signal:** Pure White (\#FFFFFF).  
  * **NO GOLD.** Color is distraction. Contrast is the only currency.  
* **Texture (The "OLED" Token):** Infinite Vector Resolution. No noise.  
  * **The Glow:** A subtle **"OLED Halation"** (Outer Glow) at 8-10% opacity. This makes the line look like a heated tungsten filament or laser projection, separating it from the void.  
* **Typography:** Code Comments. Small, lowercase, sans-serif (Courier, Roboto Mono). Linked to objects via hairline pointers.

### **2\. Motion Physics Engine (Liquid Geometry)**

We do not animate "Position." We animate **"Reasoning."**

* **The Continuous Draw (Trim Path):** The line behaves like a laser burning a path in real-time. It draws from 0% to 100%.  
* **The Morph (Shape Tween):** Objects transform to show state change. A "Knot" untangles into a "Line." A "Square" rounds into a "Circle." Matter is conserved.  
* **The Fractal Zoom (Scale):** To show depth, we zoom into a small detail (e.g., a dot), and that dot becomes the container for the next scene.

### **3\. The Timestamp Protocol**

The visual must evolve every 2 seconds to maintain retention.

* \[00:00-00:02\]: **Thesis** (The Problem / The Start).  
* \[00:02-00:04\]: **Antithesis** (The Struggle / The Transformation).  
* \[00:04-00:05\]: **Synthesis** (The Solution / The Result).

## **PART III: THE "AXIOM-BUILDER" WORKFLOW**

We use the **Reverse-Linear Construction**. We generate the **Solved Equation** first, then deconstruct it.

### **Step A: The Theorem Frame (Last Frame \- T2I)**

* **Goal:** The "Visual Proof."  
* **Word Count:** **240+ Words.**  
* **Requirement:** A massive, hyper-detailed description of the geometric primitives. Describe alignment, negative space, stroke width, glow intensity, and mathematical relationships.

### **Step B: The Empty Blackboard (First Frame \- I2I)**

* **Goal:** The "Premise."  
* **Operation:** **Deconstruction.**  
  * Delete the Solution (Final Shape).  
  * Leave the Primitives (Starting Dots / Problem Shape).  
  * Reset the Line (Undrawn).

### **Step C: The Proof (Motion \- I2V)**

* **Goal:** The "Derivation."  
* **Prompting:** Use Timestamped Prompts to guide the logic step-by-step.

## **PART IV: TEST PROMPTS (THE "AUDREY" SCRIPT)**

### **Test Set 1: "The Map" (Clarification)**

Context: "I didn't know where to look... now I have the map."

Concept: A chaotic, tangled mess untangling into a single, straight, luminous path.

#### **1\. LAST FRAME (Text-to-Image / Z-Image Turbo)**

**\[CONCEPT\]:** A minimalist vector illustration representing the cognitive concept of "Clarity emerging from Entropy." **\[COMPOSITION\]:** Centered in a vast, deep matte black void (\#050505), utilizing strictly 80% negative space to emphasize isolation and intellectual focus. **\[SUBJECT\]:** The visual consists of a single, continuous **Pure White (\#FFFFFF)** monoline vector stroke. On the far left, the line is extremely tangled, forming a dense, frantic "scribble knot" representing confusion, anxiety, and noise. As the line travels to the right, it elegantly unravels, smoothing out its jagged edges to become a perfectly straight, horizontal laser-like beam that extends to the far right edge of the frame. **\[DETAILS\]:** The line weight is constant and uniform (approx 4px), resembling a wireframe schematic. The transition from chaos to order is mathematically smooth, using Bézier curves to ease the tension. **\[GLOW\]:** The entire white line emits a subtle, technical "OLED Halation" or outer glow at approximately 8-10% opacity, giving it the appearance of a heated tungsten filament or a high-end interface element. **\[TYPOGRAPHY\]:** At the far right end of the straight line, the word "signal" is written in tiny, lowercase, sans-serif monospace font (Courier style), floating just above the line tip, anchored by a hairline indicator. **\[AESTHETIC\]:** Dan Koe / Visualize Value style. No shading, no textures, no gradients, no grey. Pure binary contrast.

#### **2\. FIRST FRAME (Image-to-Image / Qwen Edit)**

**DELETE THE STRAIGHT LINE:** Remove the entire right side of the image (the straight "signal" line and the text). **KEEP THE KNOT:** The frantic, tangled white scribble on the left remains visible. **STATE:** The line ends abruptly at the knot. It has not yet unraveled. The right side of the screen is empty black void.

#### **3\. MOTION PROMPT (I2V / Wan 2.2)**

**\[00:00-00:02\]:** THE STRUGGLE. The white scribble knot vibrates intensely in place, as if trying to break free. The lines jitter with high-frequency energy. **\[00:02-00:04\]:** THE RELEASE. The knot suddenly loosens and shoots a single line out to the right. The line draws itself rapidly across the screen (Trim Path), straightening out as it travels. **\[00:04-00:05\]:** THE CLARITY. The line hits the final point and stabilizes into a perfect horizontal beam. The label "signal" fades in.

### **Test Set 2: "The Flywheel" (Habit)**

Context: "Locking in the habit... doing it daily."

Concept: Small consistent actions (Staircase) transforming into effortless momentum (Circle).

#### **1\. LAST FRAME (Text-to-Image / Z-Image Turbo)**

**\[CONCEPT\]:** A minimalist vector illustration representing "Compound Consistency" and the "Flywheel Effect." **\[COMPOSITION\]:** A geometric abstraction centered in a pitch-black void. **\[SUBJECT\]:** The primary shape is a perfect, large **Pure White (\#FFFFFF)** circle (The Flywheel) that dominates the center. However, the circumference of the circle is not a smooth line; it is constructed from hundreds of tiny, identical "steps" or "notches," visually implying that this smooth curve was built from thousands of small, discrete actions. **\[INTERACTION\]:** A tiny, geometric "Stick Figure" (a perfect circle head and monoline body, no limbs) stands at the very top of the wheel, effortlessly walking forward like a giant hamster wheel. **\[DETAILS\]:** The line work is ultra-fine and precise (2px width). The "steps" on the circle are mathematically evenly spaced. **\[GLOW\]:** A soft 10% white ambient glow surrounds the wheel, suggesting kinetic energy and motion blur. **\[TYPOGRAPHY\]:** Inside the exact center of the wheel, the word "momentum" appears in small, spaced-out monospace letters. **\[AESTHETIC\]:** High-fidelity vector art, blueprint schematic style, intellectual minimalism. No colors.

#### **2\. FIRST FRAME (Image-to-Image / Qwen Edit)**

**BREAK THE CIRCLE:** The large circle is gone. **REPLACE WITH STAIRS:** Instead, there is a steep, jagged, linear staircase climbing upward from the bottom left. **CHANGE FIGURE:** The tiny stick figure is at the bottom of the stairs, looking up, posed in a "pushing" or "struggling" stance against the first step. **DELETE TEXT:** No words. **STATE:** A static, difficult climb before the momentum builds.

#### **3\. MOTION PROMPT (I2V / Wan 2.2)**

**\[00:00-00:02\]:** THE CLIMB. The tiny figure pushes up the steep linear staircase. The stairs are rigid and jagged. **\[00:02-00:04\]:** THE MORPH. As the figure climbs, the jagged stairs begin to soften and bend. The linear path curls inward, morphing rapidly into the large circular Flywheel. **\[00:04-00:05\]:** THE FLOW. The shape is now a perfect rotating circle. The figure is now walking effortlessly at the top. The wheel spins with a white motion blur. The text "momentum" appears in the center.

## **PART V: IMMUTABLE CONSISTENCY GUARDRAILS**

1. **The "Monoline" Law:** The line width must remain constant. It does not get thick and thin like a brush. It is a wire.  
2. **The "No Sharp Edges" Law (Softened):** While squares exist, their interactions are fluid. Sharp edges represent "Problems." Curves represent "Solutions."  
3. **The "Binary Color" Law:** **White** Lines. **Black** Background. **NO GOLD.** NO GREY. The contrast must be absolute.  
4. **The "Self-Draw" Law:** The line must always animate as if being drawn by an invisible laser. It never fades in.  
5. **The "Glow Cap" Law:** Glow must never exceed 15%. It is a "Halation," not a "Bloom." It keeps the lines looking sharp, not fuzzy.  
6. **The "Reduction" Law:** If it can be drawn with fewer lines, redraw it. Eliminate all decoration.
